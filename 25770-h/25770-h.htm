<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE NIGHT OF THE STORM</h3>
</div>

<p>It had been a magnificent afternoon, so
wonderful that Leslie hated to break the
spell. Reluctantly she unrolled herself from
the Indian blanket, from which she emerged
like a butterfly from a cocoon, draped it over
her arm, picked up the book she had not once
opened, and turned for a last, lingering look
at the ocean. A lavender haze lay lightly
along the horizon. Nearer inshore the blue of
sea and sky was intense. A line of breakers
raced shoreward, their white manes streaming
back in the wind. Best of all, Leslie loved the
flawless green of their curve at the instant before
they crashed on the beach.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but the ocean&#8217;s wonderful in October!&#8221;
she murmured aloud. &#8220;I never had any idea
<i>how</i> wonderful. I never saw it in this month
before. Come, Rags!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A black-and-white English sheep-dog, his
name corresponding closely to his appearance,
came racing up the beach at her call.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you find it hard to tear yourself away
from the hermit-crabs, Ragsie?&#8221; she laughed.
&#8220;You must have gobbled down more than a
hundred. It&#8217;s high time you left off!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She started to race along the deserted beach,
the dog leaping ahead of her and yapping
ecstatically. Twice she stopped to pick up
some driftwood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll need it to get supper, Rags,&#8221; she
informed the dog. &#8220;Our stock is getting low.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He cocked one ear at her intelligently.
</p>
<p>They came presently to a couple of summer
bungalows set side by side about two hundred
feet from the ocean edge. They were long
and low, each with a wide veranda stretching
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
across the front. There were no other houses
near, the next bungalow beyond being about
half a mile away.
</p>
<p>With a sigh of relief, Leslie deposited the
driftwood in one corner of the veranda of the
nearest bungalow. Then she dropped into one
of the willow rockers to rest, the dog panting
at her feet. Presently the screen door opened
and a lady stepped out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! are you here, Leslie? I thought I
heard a sound, and then it was so quiet that I
came out to see what it meant. Every little
noise seems to startle me this afternoon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry, Aunt Marcia! I should
have called to you,&#8221; said Leslie, starting up
contritely to help her aunt to a seat. &#8220;I hope
you had a good nap and feel rested, but sometimes
I think it would do you more good if
you&#8217;d come out with me and sit by the ocean
than try to lie down in your room. It was
simply glorious to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Marcia Crane shook her head. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
know what is best for me, Leslie dear. You
don&#8217;t always understand. But I believe this
place <i>is</i> doing me a great deal of good. I confess,
I thought Dr. Crawford insane when he
suggested it, and I came here with the greatest
reluctance. For a nervous invalid like myself
to go and hide away in such a forsaken spot as
this is in October, just you and I, seemed to
me the wildest piece of folly. But I must say
it appears to be working out all right, and I am
certainly feeling better already.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why <i>shouldn&#8217;t</i> it have been all right?&#8221;
argued Leslie. &#8220;I was always sure it would
be. The doctor said this beach was noted for
its wonderfully restful effect, especially after
the summer crowds had left it, and that it was
far better than a sanatorium. And as for your
being alone with me&mdash;why I&#8217;m sixteen and
a quite competent housekeeper, as Mother
says. And you don&#8217;t need a trained nurse, so
I can do most everything for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But your school&mdash;&#8221; objected Miss Crane.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
&#8220;It was lovely of your mother to allow you to
come with me, for I don&#8217;t know another person
who would have been so congenial or helpful.
But I worry constantly over the time you are
losing from high school.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t you worry another bit!&#8221;
laughed Leslie. &#8220;I told you that my chum
Elsie is sending me down all our notes, and I
study an hour or two every morning, and I&#8217;ll
probably go right on with my classes when I go
back. Besides, it&#8217;s the greatest lark in the
world for me to be here at the ocean at this unusual
time of the year. I never in all my life
had an experience like it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And then, I didn&#8217;t think at first that it
could possibly be <i>safe</i>!&#8221; went on her aunt.
&#8220;We seem quite unprotected here&mdash;we&#8217;re
miles from a railroad station, and not another
inhabited house around. What would happen
if&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Leslie laughed. &#8220;We&#8217;ve a telephone
in the bungalow and can call up the village
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
doctor or the constable, in case of need. The
doctor said there weren&#8217;t any tramps or unwelcome
characters about, and I&#8217;ve certainly
never seen any in the two weeks we&#8217;ve been
here. And, last but not least, there&#8217;s always
Rags!&mdash;You know how extremely unpleasant
he&#8217;d make it for any one who tried to harm us.
No, Aunt Marcia, you haven&#8217;t a ghost of an
excuse for not feeling perfectly safe. But
now I&#8217;m going in to start supper. You stay
here and enjoy the view.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But her aunt shivered and rose when Leslie
did. &#8220;No, I prefer to sit by the open fire. I
started it a while ago. And I&#8217;m glad you
brought some more wood. It was getting low.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As they went in together, the girl glanced
up at the faded and weather-beaten sign over
the door. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the most appropriate
name for this place!&mdash;&#8216;Rest Haven.&#8217; It is
surely a haven of rest to us. But I think I
like the name of that closed cottage next door
even better.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked her aunt, idly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
never even had the curiosity to look.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you must come and see for yourself!&#8221;
laughed Leslie, turning her aunt about and
gently forcing her across the veranda. They
ploughed their way across a twenty-foot
stretch of sand and stepped on the veranda of
the cottage next door. It was a bungalow
somewhat similar to their own, but plainly
closed up for the winter. The windows had
their board shutters adjusted, the door was
padlocked, and a small heap of sand had
drifted in on the veranda.
</p>
<p>Leslie pointed to the sign-board over the
door. &#8220;There it is,&mdash;<i>&#8216;Curlew&#8217;s Nest.&#8217;</i>
There&#8217;s something about the name that fascinates
me. Don&#8217;t you feel so too, Aunt Marcia?
I can imagine all sorts of curious and
wonderful things about a closed-up house
called &#8216;Curlew&#8217;s Nest&#8217;! It just fairly bristles
with possibilities!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a romantic child you are, Leslie!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
smiled her aunt. &#8220;When you are as old as I
am, you&#8217;ll find you won&#8217;t be thinking of interesting
possibilities in a perfectly ordinary shut-up
summer bungalow. It&#8217;s a pretty enough
name, of course, but I must confess it doesn&#8217;t
suggest a single thing to me except that I&#8217;m
cold and want to get back to the fire. Come
along, dearie!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie sighed and turned back, without another
word, to lead her aunt to their own abode.
One phase of their stay she had been very, very
careful to conceal from Miss Marcia. She
loved this aunt devotedly, all the more perhaps
because she was ill and weak and nervous and
very dependent on her niece&#8217;s care; but down
in the depths of her soul, Leslie had to confess
to herself that she was lonely, horribly lonely
for the companionship of her parents and sisters
and school chums. The loneliness did not
always bother her, but it came over her at times
like an overwhelming wave, usually when Miss
Marcia failed to respond to some whim or project
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
or bubbling enthusiasm. Between them
gaped the abyss of forty years difference in
age, and more than a score of times Leslie had
yearned for some one of her own years to share
the joy she felt in her unusual surroundings.
</p>
<p>As they stepped on their own veranda,
Leslie glanced out to sea with a start of surprise.
&#8220;Why, look how it&#8217;s clouding up!&#8221; she
exclaimed. &#8220;It was as clear as a bell a few
minutes ago, and now the blue sky is disappearing
rapidly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew to-day was a weather-breeder,&#8221;
averred Miss Marcia. &#8220;I felt in my bones that
a storm was coming. We&#8217;ll probably get it
to-night. I do hope the roof won&#8217;t leak. We
haven&#8217;t had a real bad storm since we came,
and I dread the experience.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At eight o&#8217;clock that evening it became apparent
that they were in for a wild night. The
wind had whipped around to the northeast
and was blowing a gale. There was a persistent
crash of breakers on the beach. To
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
open a door or window was to admit a small
cyclone of wind and sand and rain. Miss
Marcia sat for a while over the open fire, bemoaning
the fact that the roof <i>did</i> leak in
spots, though fortunately not over the beds.
She was depressed and nervous, and finally declared
she would go to bed.
</p>
<p>But Leslie, far from being nervous, was
wildly excited and exhilarated by the conflict
of the elements. When her aunt had finally
retired, she hurried on a big mackinaw and cap
and slipped out to the veranda to enjoy it better.
Rags, whimpering, followed her. There
was not much to see, for the night was pitch
black, but she enjoyed the feel of the wind
and rain in her face and the little occasional
dashes of sand. Wet through at last, but
happy, she crept noiselessly indoors and went
to her own room on the opposite side of the
big living-room from her aunt&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad Aunt Marcia is on the other side,&#8221;
she thought. &#8220;It&#8217;s quieter there on the south
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
and west. I get the full force of things here.
It would only worry her, but I like it. How
lonesome Curlew&#8217;s Nest seems on a wild night
like this!&#8221; She switched off her electric light,
raised her shade, and looked over at the empty
bungalow. Rags, who always slept in her
room, jumped up on the window-seat beside
her. The mingled sand and rain on the window
prevented her from seeing anything
clearly, so she slipped the sash quietly open,
and, heedless for a moment of the drenching
inrush, stood gazing out.
</p>
<p>Only the wall of the house twenty feet away
was visible, with two or three windows, all
tightly shuttered&mdash;a deserted and lonely sight.
She was just about to close her window when
a curious thing happened. The dog beside her
uttered a rumbling, half-suppressed growl and
moved restlessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Rags?&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Do
you see or hear anything? I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s
no one around.&#8221; The dog grumbled again,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
half audibly, and the hair along his spine lifted
a little.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, Rags! For gracious sake don&#8217;t let
Aunt Marcia hear you, whatever happens! It
would upset her terribly,&#8221; breathed Leslie,
distractedly. The dog obediently lay quiet,
but he continued to tremble with some obscure
excitement, and Leslie remained stock still,
gazing at the empty house.
</p>
<p>At length, neither seeing nor hearing anything
unusual, she was about to close the window
and turn away, when something caused
her to lean out, regardless of the rain, and stare
fixedly at a window in the opposite wall. Was
she mistaken? Did her eyes deceive her?
Was it possibly some freak of the darkness or
the storm? It had been only for an instant,
and it did not happen again. But in that instant
she was almost certain that she had seen
a faint streak of light from a crack at the side
of one of the heavily shuttered windows!

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>FOUND ON THE BEACH</h3>
</div>

<p>The next morning dawned windy and wet.
A heavy northeast gale had whipped the
sea into gray, mountainous waves. A fine
drizzle beat in one&#8217;s face through the slightest
opening of door or window. Leslie loved the
soft, salt tang of the air, and in spite of her
aunt&#8217;s rather horrified protests, prepared for
a long excursion out of doors.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about me, Auntie dear!&#8221; she
laughed gaily. &#8220;One can&#8217;t possibly catch cold
in this mild, beautiful air; and if I get wet, I
can always get dry again before any damage
is done. Besides, we need some more wood
for the fires very, very badly and they say you
can simply find heaps of it on the beach after
a storm like this. I want some nice fat logs
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
for our open fire, and I see at least a half dozen
right down in front of this house. And last
but not least, Rags needs some exercise!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She found a wealth of driftwood at the
water&#8217;s edge that surpassed her wildest
dreams. Again and again she filled her
basket and hauled it up to the bungalow, and
three times she carried up a large, water-soaked
log balanced on her shoulder. But when the
supply at last appeared ample, she returned
to the beach on another quest. Rather to her
surprise, she found that the stormy ocean had
cast up many things beside driftwood&mdash;articles
that in size and variety suggested that there
must have been a wreck in the night.
</p>
<p>Yet she knew that there had been no wreck,
else the coast-guard station, less than a mile
away, would have been very busy, and she herself
must surely have heard some of the disturbance.
No, there had been no wreck, yet
all about her lay the wave-sodden flotsam and
jetsam of many past disasters. A broken mast
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
stump was imbedded upright in the sand at
one spot. In another, a ladder-like pair of
stairs, suggesting a ship&#8217;s companionway, lay
half out of the water. Sundry casks and barrels
dotted the beach, some empty, some still
untouched. Rusty tins of canned goods, oil,
and paint, often intact, intermingled with the
debris. Bottles, either empty or full of every
conceivable liquid, added to the list; and
sprinkled through and around all the rest were
broken dishes, shoe-brushes, combs, and other
household and personal articles in surprising
quantities.
</p>
<p>Leslie roamed about among this varied collection,
the salt spray in her face, the surging
breakers sometimes unexpectedly curling
around her rubber boots. There was a new
and wonderful fascination to her in examining
this ancient wreckage, speculating on the contents
of unopened tins, and searching ever farther
and farther along the shore for possible
treasure-trove of even greater interest or value.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why <i>shouldn&#8217;t</i> I find a chest of jewels or
a barrel full of golden coins or a pocket-book
crammed with bills, Rags?&#8221; she demanded
whimsically of the jubilant dog. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure
something of that kind must go down with
every ship, as well as all the rest of this stuff,
and why shouldn&#8217;t we be lucky enough to find
it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Rags was busy investigating the contents
of some doubtful-looking tin, and had
neither time nor inclination to respond, his own
particular quests being quite in another line
and far more interesting to him!
</p>
<p>So Leslie continued on her own way, absorbed
in her own investigations and thoughts.
The affair of the previous night was still occupying
a large place in her mind. Nothing
further had occurred, though she had watched
at her window for nearly an hour. Even
Rags at length ceased to exhibit signs of uneasiness,
and she had gone to bed at last, feeling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
that she must have been mistaken in imagining
anything unusual.
</p>
<p>The first thing she had done this morning
after leaving the house was to walk around
Curlew&#8217;s Nest, examining it carefully for any
sign of occupation. It was closed and shuttered,
as tight as a drum, and she could discern
no slightest sign of a human being having
been near it for days. But still she could not
rid her mind of the impression that there had
been <i>something</i> last night out of the ordinary,
or Rags would not have behaved as he did.
He was not the kind of dog that unnecessarily
excited himself about nothing. It was a little
bit strange.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! I beg your pardon! I&#8217;m awfully
sorry!&#8221; exclaimed Leslie, reeling backward
from the shock of collision with some one
she had unseeingly bumped into as she plowed
her way along, her head bent to the wind, her
eyes only on the beach at her feet. The person
with whom she had collided also recovered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
a lost balance and turned to looked at her.
</p>
<p>Leslie beheld a figure slightly taller than
herself, clothed in yellow &#8220;slickers&#8221; and long
rubber boots, a &#8220;sou&#8217;wester&#8221; pulled closely over
plump, rosy cheeks and big, inquiring blue
eyes. For a moment she could not for the
life of her tell whether the figure was man or
woman, boy or girl. Then a sudden gust of
wind tore the sou&#8217;wester aside and a long brown
curl escaped and whipped into the blue eyes.
It was a girl&mdash;very little older than Leslie
herself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it!&#8221; laughed the girl. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t know there was another soul on the
beach beside Father and Ted and myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then, for the first time, Leslie noticed
two other figures standing just beyond, each
clad similarly to the girl, and each with fishing-rod
in hand and a long line running out into
the boiling surf. The girl too held a rod in
her hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You just spoiled the loveliest bite I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
had this morning,&#8221; the girl laughed again,
&#8220;but I&#8217;ll forgive you if you&#8217;ll tell me who you
are and how you come to be out here in this
bad weather. It&#8217;s quite unusual to see any
one on the beach at this season.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Leslie Crane, and I&#8217;m staying at
Rest Haven with my aunt, Miss Crane, who
is not well and is trying to recuperate here, according
to the doctor&#8217;s orders,&#8221; responded
Leslie, feeling somewhat like an information
bureau as she said it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, so you&#8217;re staying here, are you? How
jolly! I&#8217;ve never met any one staying here
at this season before. I&#8217;m Phyllis Kelvin and
this is my father and my brother Ted. Father&mdash;Miss
Leslie Crane! Ted&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>She made the introductions at the top of her
voice as the wind and roar of the ocean almost
drowned it, and each of the two figures responded
politely, keeping one eye all the while
on his line.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We always come down here for three weeks
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
in October, Father and Ted and I, for the fishing,&#8221;
Phyllis went on to explain. &#8220;Father
adores fishing and always takes his vacation
late down here, so that he can have the fishing
in peace and at its best. And Ted and I come
to keep him company and keep house for him,
incidentally. That&#8217;s our bungalow right back
there,&mdash;&#8216;Fisherman&#8217;s Luck.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re going to be here!&#8221;
sighed Leslie, happily. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been horribly
lonesome! Aunt Marcia does not go out very
often and sleeps a great deal, and I absolutely
<i>long</i> to talk to some one at times. I don&#8217;t
know anything much about fishing, but I hope
you&#8217;ll let me be with you some, if I promise
not to talk too much and spoil things!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not a bit happier to find some one
than <i>I</i> am!&#8221; echoed Phyllis. &#8220;I love fishing,
too, but I&#8217;m not so crazy about it as they are,
and I&#8217;ve often longed for some girl chum down
here. We&#8217;re going to be the best of friends,
I know, and I&#8217;ll call on you and your aunt this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
very afternoon, if you&#8217;ll come up to our bungalow
now with me and help carry this basket of
driftwood. Daddy and Ted won&#8217;t move from
the beach for the rest of the morning, but I&#8217;d
like to stop and talk with you. I get tired
sooner than they do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie agreed joyfully, and together they
tugged a heavy basket of wood up to the one
other bungalow on the beach beside the one
Leslie and her aunt were stopping at&mdash;and
Curlew&#8217;s Nest. She found Fisherman&#8217;s Luck
a delightful abode, full of the pleasant, intimate
touches that could only be imparted by
owners who inhabited it themselves most of the
time. A roaring fire blazed invitingly in the
big open fireplace in the living-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, take off your things and stay awhile!&#8221;
urged Phyllis, and Leslie removed her mackinaw
and cap. The two girls sank down in big
easy chairs before the fire and laughingly
agreeing to drop formality, proceeded as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
&#8220;Phyllis&#8221; and &#8220;Leslie,&#8221; to exchange confidences
in true girl fashion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mustn&#8217;t stay long,&#8221; remarked Leslie.
&#8220;Aunt Marcia will be missing me and I must
go back to see about lunch. But what a delightful
bungalow you have! Are you here
much of the time?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re here a good deal in the off seasons&mdash;April
to June, and September through November.
Father, Ted, and I,&mdash;but we don&#8217;t
care for it so much in the summer season when
the beach is more crowded with vacation folks
and that big hotel farther up the beach is full.
We have some cousins who usually take the
bungalow for July and August.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never was at the ocean in October before,&#8221;
sighed Leslie, comfortably, &#8220;and it&#8217;s perfectly
heavenly! We have that dear little bungalow,
Rest Haven, but the one right next to it is not
occupied.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Phyllis, &#8220;and it&#8217;s queer, too. I
never knew either of them to be occupied at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
this season before. They are both owned by
the Danforths, and they usually shut them both
up on September 30 and refuse to open them
till the beginning of the next season. How
did you come to get one of them, may I
ask?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I think Aunt Marcia&#8217;s doctor managed
it. He happened to know the Danforths
personally, and got them to break their rule,
as a great favor to him. We appreciate it
very much. But do you know,&#8221; and here
Leslie unconsciously sank her voice, &#8220;I saw
such a queer thing about that other bungalow
late yesterday evening!&#8221; And she recounted
to her new friend a history of the previous
night&#8217;s experience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how perfectly gorgeous!&#8221; sighed Phyllis,
thrilled beyond description by the narrative.
&#8220;Do you suppose it&#8217;s <i>haunted?</i> I&#8217;ve
heard of haunted houses, but never of a haunted
<i>bungalow!</i> Now don&#8217;t laugh at me,&mdash;that&#8217;s
what Ted and Father do when I speak of such
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
things,&#8221; for Leslie could not repress a giggle
at this suggestion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Phyllis, you <i>know</i> there are no such things
as haunted houses&mdash;really!&#8221; she remonstrated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not so sure of it, and anyway,
I&#8217;ve always <i>longed</i> to come across one! And
what other explanation can there be for this
thing, anyway? But do me one favor, won&#8217;t
you, Leslie? Let&#8217;s keep this thing to ourselves
and do a little investigating on our own
account. If I tell Father and Ted and let
them know what I think, they&#8217;ll simply hoot
at me and go and spoil it all by breaking the
place open and tramping around it themselves
and scaring away any possible ghost there
might be. Let&#8217;s just see if we can make anything
out of it ourselves, will you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why of course I will,&#8221; agreed Leslie heartily.
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t dare to let Aunt Marcia
know there was anything queer about the place.
She&#8217;d be scared to death and it would upset
all the doctor&#8217;s plans for her. I don&#8217;t believe
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
in the ghost theory, but I <i>do</i> think there may
have been something mysterious about it, and
it will be no end of a lark to track it down if
we can. But I must be going now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming with you!&#8221; announced the impetuous
Phyllis. &#8220;I want to go up there right
away and do a little looking about myself. I
simply can&#8217;t wait.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So they set off together, trudging through
the sand at the edge of the ocean, where the
walking was easiest. All the way, Leslie was
wondering what had become of Rags. It was
not often that he deserted her even for five
minutes, but she had not seen him since her encounter
with Phyllis. It was not till their arrival
at Curlew&#8217;s Nest that she discovered his
whereabouts.
</p>
<p>Directly in front of this bungalow&#8217;s veranda,
and about fifty feet away from it, lay the remains
of a huge old tree-trunk, half buried in
the sand. Almost under this trunk, only his
rear quarters visible, was the form of Rags,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
digging frantically at a great hole in the wet
sand. So deep now was the hole that the dog
was more than half buried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Rags! He&#8217;s after another hermit-crab!&#8221;
cried Leslie. &#8220;I was wondering
where he could be.&#8221; They both raced up to
him and reached him just as he had apparently
attained the end of his quest and backed out
of the hole.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what has he got?&#8221; exclaimed Phyllis.
&#8220;That&#8217;s no hermit-crab!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And in truth it was not. For out of the
hole the dog was dragging a small burlap sack
which plainly contained some heavy article in
its folds!
</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<a name='III_THE_MYSTERIOUS_CASKET' id='III_THE_MYSTERIOUS_CASKET'></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE MYSTERIOUS CASKET</h3>
</div>

<p>Both girls dashed forward to snatch the
dog&#8217;s treasure-trove from him. But
Rags had apparently made up his mind that,
after his arduous labors, he was going to have
the privilege of examining his find himself.
At any rate, he would not be easily robbed.
Seizing the burlap bag in his mouth, he raced
to the water&#8217;s edge and stood there, guarding
his treasure with mock fierceness. Phyllis, being
a stranger, he would not even allow to approach
him, but growled ominously if she came
within ten feet of his vicinity. And when
Rags growled, it behooved the stranger to
have a care! Leslie he pretended to welcome,
but no sooner had she approached near enough
to lay her hand on the bag than he seized
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
it triumphantly and raced up the beach.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, do grab him, somehow!&#8221; cried Phyllis,
in despair. &#8220;He&#8217;ll drop the thing in the water
and the next breaker will wash it away, and
we&#8217;ll never know what it was!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie herself was no less anxious to filch
his treasure, but Rags had by now acquired a
decidedly frolicsome spirit, and the chase he
led them was long and weary. Three times he
dropped the bag directly in the path of a
breaker, and once it was actually washed out,
and the girls groaned in chorus as they saw it
flung into the boiling surf. But another wave
washed it ashore, only to land it again in the
custody of Rags before Leslie could seize it.
</p>
<p>Finally, however, he wearied of the sport,
and sensing the sad fact that his prize was in
no wise edible, he dropped it suddenly to pursue
an unsuspecting hermit-crab. The girls
fell joyfully upon the long-sought treasure
and bore it to the veranda of Curlew&#8217;s Nest for
further examination.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What under the sun can it be?&#8221; marveled
the curious Phyllis. &#8220;Something heavy, and
all sewed up in a coarse bag like that! It&#8217;s as
good as a ghost story. Let&#8217;s get at it right
away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They sat down on the wet steps while Leslie
unrolled the bag,&mdash;not much larger than a big
salt-bag,&mdash;and tried to tear an opening at the
top. But her slender fingers were not equal to
the task, so Phyllis undertook it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me try!&#8221; she urged. &#8220;I play the piano
a great deal and my fingers are very strong.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And sure enough, it did not take her more
than a moment to make an opening and thrust
her hand into it. What she found there she
drew out and laid in Leslie&#8217;s lap, while the two
girls gasped simultaneously at the singular
object they had discovered.
</p>
<p>To begin with, it was encrusted with sand
and corroded by the contact of salt air and seawater.
But when they had brushed off the
sand and polished it as well as they could with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
the burlap bag, it stood forth in something of
its original appearance&mdash;a small box or casket
of some heavy metal, either bronze or copper,
completely covered with elaborate carving. It
was about six inches long, three wide, and two
in height. It stood on four legs, and, upon
examination, the carving proved to be the body
of a winged serpent of some kind, completely
encircling the box, the head projecting over
the front edge where the lock or fastening of
the cover would be. The legs of the receptacle
were the creature&#8217;s claws. The carving
was remarkably fine and delicate in workmanship.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My gracious!&#8221; breathed Phyllis. &#8220;Did you
ever see anything so strange! What can it
be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And isn&#8217;t it beautiful!&#8221; added Leslie.
&#8220;What can that queer creature be that&#8217;s carved
on it? Looks to me like the pictures of dragons
that we used to have in fairy-story books.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what it is! You&#8217;ve hit it! I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
couldn&#8217;t think what it was at first&mdash;it&#8217;s so
wound around the box!&#8221; cried Phyllis. &#8220;But
this thing is certainly a box of some kind, and
there must be some opening to it and probably
something in it. Let&#8217;s try now to get it
open.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But that was easier said than done. Try as
they would, they could find no way of opening
the casket. The dragon&#8217;s head came down
over the lock or clasp, and there was no vestige
of keyhole or catch or spring. And so intricate
was the carving, that there was not even
any crack or crevice where the lid fitted down
over the body of the box into which they could
insert Phyllis&#8217;s penknife blade to pry it open
by force. The casket and its contents was a
baffling mystery, and the wicked looking little
dragon seemed to guard the secret with positive
glee, so malicious was its expression!
</p>
<p>Phyllis at last threw down her knife in disgust
and rattled the box impatiently. &#8220;Something
bumps around in there!&#8221; she declared.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
&#8220;I can hear it distinctly, but I don&#8217;t believe
we&#8217;ll ever be able to get at it. I never saw
such a queer affair! Let&#8217;s try to break it with
an ax. Have you one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t do <i>that!</i>&#8221; cried Leslie, horrified.
&#8220;It would surely spoil this beautiful box and
might even injure what&#8217;s in it. There must
be <i>some</i> other way of getting it open if only
we take our time and go at it carefully.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They both sat for several moments regarding
their find with resentful curiosity. Suddenly
Leslie&#8217;s thoughts took a new tack,
&#8220;How in the world did it ever come there&mdash;buried
in the sand like that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thrown up on the beach by the waves, of
course,&#8221; declared Phyllis, positively; &#8220;no
doubt from some wreck, and buried in the
sand after a while, just naturally, as lots of
things are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The explanation was a very probable one.
&#8220;But it&#8217;s rather far from the water&#8217;s edge,&#8221;
objected Leslie.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, indeed! Why in winter the surf
often comes up right under the bungalows!&#8221;
remarked Phyllis, in quite an offhanded way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy! Don&#8217;t ever tell Aunt Marcia that,
or she&#8217;d go straight home!&#8221; exclaimed Leslie.
&#8220;But isn&#8217;t it queer that it just happened to be
right in front of Curlew&#8217;s Nest! Everything
queer seems to happen right around that
place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so! I&#8217;d almost forgotten the other
thing. But what <i>I</i> can&#8217;t understand is how
your dog happened to dig the thing up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s simple! He&#8217;s always chasing
hermit-crabs&mdash;it&#8217;s a great sport of his. And I
suppose it just happened that one dug itself
down in the sand right here, and he dug after
it and then came across this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Phyllis had a sudden brilliant idea. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
go and examine the hole! Perhaps there&#8217;s
something else in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They both raced over to the stump and
Leslie thrust her hand into the hole. &#8220;There&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
nothing else in there,&#8221; she averred, &#8220;but perhaps
it might be worth while to dig around here
and see if there might be some other article
buried near it. I&#8217;ll get a shovel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She disappeared behind her own bungalow
for a moment and returned with a shovel.
They dug furiously for ten minutes and turned
up the sand all about the original hole. Nothing
of the slightest interest came to light, however,
and they presently abandoned the attempt
and filled in the hole again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is all there was&mdash;that&#8217;s plain,&#8221; declared
Phyllis, &#8220;and all we can think is that it
was cast up from some wreck and got buried
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Leslie had been thinking. &#8220;Has it occurred
to you, Phyllis, that it <i>might</i> have something
to do with Curlew&#8217;s Nest and the queer
thing that happened here? I wonder how long
it has been lying in that hole?&#8221;
</p>
<p>They examined the find again. &#8220;I can tell
you one thing,&#8221; said Phyllis, &#8220;if it had been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
in that sand a <i>long</i> time, I think it would look
rather different. To begin with, the burlap
bag is in very good condition, whole and strong.
It wouldn&#8217;t take <i>very</i> long in there for it to
become ragged and go to pieces. And besides
that, the box would look different. You know
that metal like this gets badly corroded and
tarnished in a very little while when it&#8217;s exposed
even to this salt air, not to speak of the
water too. I know, because we have some copper
trays at the bungalow and they&#8217;re always
a <i>sight</i>! I have to keep polishing and polishing
them to make them look nice. Now this
box is very little tarnished since we rubbed it
up. It makes me sure it hasn&#8217;t been buried
long.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, has there been a wreck, then, very
lately?&#8221; demanded Leslie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not since last July&mdash;and that was only a
fishing schooner. No chance in the world that
such as <i>this</i> would be aboard of her!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, as far as I can see, this box must
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
have been buried here&mdash;deliberately&mdash;and very
recently, too!&#8221; declared Leslie, solemnly.
&#8220;Can you think of any other explanation?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Leslie, could it have been done last night?&#8221;
demanded Phyllis, in an awed whisper.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;I never thought of that. Perhaps it
was. Perhaps that was the meaning of the
light and all. Phyllis, there&#8217;s some queer
mystery here! I wonder if we ought to tell
folks about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh <i>don&#8217;t!</i>&#8221; implored Phyllis. &#8220;Not for a
while, at least. It would be so wonderful to
have this as a secret of our own and see what
we can make of it. Just suppose we could
work it out for ourselves!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;it <i>would</i> be a lark, and I only hope
it&#8217;s all right. But I&#8217;m going to ask you one
favor, Phyllis. Please take the little box and
keep it at your house, for I don&#8217;t want Aunt
Marcia to be worried about the matter, and
she might come across it if I kept it here. And
I must be going in now, or she&#8217;ll be worried.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
And she thrust the box into Phyllis&#8217;s hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, I&#8217;ll keep it gladly and hide it
safely, too. This is one secret I won&#8217;t have
Ted meddling in!&#8221; declared Phyllis. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
call the box &#8216;The Dragon&#8217;s Secret.&#8217; He seems
to be guarding very successfully! I&#8217;ll come
back this afternoon and call, and we can talk
this over some more. Good-by!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And she turned away toward the direction
of her own bungalow, with &#8220;The Dragon&#8217;s
Secret&#8221; carefully concealed beneath her rainproof
coat.

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>IN THE SAND</h3>
</div>

<p>The northeaster lasted three days. Then
it blew itself out, the wind shifted to the
northwest, and there was beautiful sparkling
weather for the rest of the week.
</p>
<p>During this time, the two new friends came
to know each other very well indeed. It was
not only their little shared mystery that united
them&mdash;they found they had congenial tastes
and interests in very many directions, although
they were so different in temperament. Leslie
was slight and dark in appearance, rather timid
in disposition, and inclined to be shy and hesitant
in manner. Phyllis was quite the opposite&mdash;large
and plump and rosy, courageous
and independent, jolly, and often headlong and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
thoughtless in action. Her mother had died
when she was very little, and she had grown
up mainly in the care of nurses and servants,
from whom she had imbibed some very queer
notions, as Leslie was not long in discovering.
One of these was her firm belief in ghosts and
haunted houses, which not even the robust and
wholesome contempt of her father and older
brother Ted had succeeded in changing.
</p>
<p>But Phyllis had a special gift which drew
the two girls together with a strong attraction:
she was a devoted lover of music and so accomplished
a pianist as to be almost a genius&mdash;for
one of her age. The whole family seemed to
be musical. Her father played the &#8217;cello and
Ted the violin, but Phyllis&#8217;s work at the piano
far surpassed theirs. And Leslie, too, loved
music devotedly, though she neither sang nor
played any instrument. It was a revelation to
her when, on the next rainy afternoon, she accompanied
Phyllis to the living-room of Fisherman&#8217;s
Luck and listened to a recital such as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
she had never expected to hear outside of a
concert-hall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Phyllis, it&#8217;s wonderful&mdash;simply wonderful!&#8221;
she sighed blissfully when the last
liquid ripples of a Chopin waltz had died away.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you ever learned to play like
that! But what in the world are you going to
do now?&#8221; For Phyllis had jumped up with
an impatient exclamation, laid back the cover
of the grand piano, and was hunting frantically
in the music cabinet for something.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;m going to tune the old thing!&#8221;
she declared. &#8220;This salt air is enough to
wreck any piano, and this one is so old that it&#8217;s
below pitch most of the time. But of course it
wouldn&#8217;t do to have a very good one here.
That&#8217;s why Dad sent this one down. I just
<i>had</i> to learn to tune it, in self-defense, or we
could never have used it. So here goes!&mdash;&#8221;
And, to Leslie&#8217;s breathless amazement, she proceeded
to tune the instrument with the most
professional air in the world.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Phyllis, you&#8217;re amazing!&#8221; murmured
Leslie, at length. &#8220;But, tell me&mdash;what do
you intend to do with this wonderful gift you
have? Surely you&#8217;ll make it your career&mdash;or
something like that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course I <i>want</i> to,&#8221; confided her
friend. &#8220;To be candid&mdash;I&#8217;m crazy to. It&#8217;s
about the only thing I think of. But Father
won&#8217;t hear of it. He says he will let me have
all the advantages he can, for an amateur, but
that&#8217;s all he&#8217;s willing or can afford to do. Of
course, I&#8217;m only seventeen and I&#8217;ve got to
finish high school, at least. But I&#8217;m wild to
go afterward to some one of the great European
teachers and study for a year or two, and
then see what happens. That, however, would
cost at least two or three thousand dollars,
and Father says he simply can&#8217;t afford it. So
there you are. It&#8217;s awful to have an ambition
and no way of encouraging it! But I&#8217;m always
hoping that something will turn up.&#8221;
And Phyllis returned to her tuning.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Two or three thousand dollars would be
a pretty handy sum to have!&#8221; laughed Leslie.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been rather on the lookout for some such
amount myself, but for a somewhat different
reason.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll warrant you have an ambition,
too! Now tell me about it!&#8221; cried Phyllis,
pouncing on her and ignoring the piano.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is an ambition,&#8221; acknowledged Leslie,
&#8220;but it isn&#8217;t a bit like you. I hardly
think you could call it an ambition&mdash;just a
<i>wish</i>. You see, it&#8217;s this way. We&#8217;re rather
a big family at home, four of us children, and
I&#8217;m the oldest; and Father&#8217;s rather delicate
and has never been able to hold a good position
long because he&#8217;s out so much with illness.
We get along fairly well&mdash;all but little Ralph.
He&#8217;s my special pet, four year old, but he&#8217;s
lame&mdash;had some hip trouble ever since he was
a baby. He could be cured, the doctors say,
by a very expensive operation and some special
care. But we haven&#8217;t the money for it&mdash;just
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
yet. We&#8217;re always hoping something
will turn up, too, and my plan is to hurry
through high school and training-school and
then teach, and save every spare penny for
Ralph. But it seems an awfully long time to
wait, and all the while that little tot isn&#8217;t getting
any better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There were tears in her eyes as she reached
this point, and the impetuous Phyllis hugged
her. &#8220;You darling thing! I think you&#8217;re too
unselfish for words! It makes me feel
ashamed of my own selfish, foolish little wish.
Wouldn&#8217;t it be gorgeous if we could find four
or five thousand dollars lying around on the
beach? Wouldn&#8217;t it just&mdash;&#8221; She stopped
abruptly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; inquired Leslie.
&#8220;Anything wrong?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;something just occurred to me.
What if that wretched little dragon of ours
was guarding just such a fortune? It might
be jewels or bank-notes or&mdash;or <i>something</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
equally valuable! I&#8217;m going to get it right
away and make another try at opening it. It
makes me furious, every time I think of it, to
be so&mdash;so balked about getting at anything!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Phyllis,&#8221; objected Leslie, &#8220;even if
there <i>were</i> any such thing, I don&#8217;t believe we&#8217;d
have a right to keep it. It must belong to
<i>somebody</i>, and we ought to make an effort to
find out who. Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, if it&#8217;s any <i>real</i> person&mdash;I suppose
so,&#8221; admitted Phyllis. &#8220;But what if&mdash;&#8221;
She stopped significantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now <i>don&#8217;t</i> tell me it was hidden there by
<i>ghosts</i>!&#8221; And Leslie&#8217;s infectious laugh pealed
out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hush! or Ted will hear. He can&#8217;t be
far away,&#8221; implored Phyllis, guiltily. &#8220;Of
course, I don&#8217;t say what or whom it was hidden
by, but there&#8217;s something mighty queer to me
about an empty bungalow being inhabited by
<i>living folks</i>&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What about burglars?&#8221; interrupted Leslie,
quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never <i>was</i> such a thing around these parts,
in any one&#8217;s experience!&#8221; Phyllis hastened to
assure her, much to her secret relief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then perhaps it&#8217;s the people who own the
cottage,&#8221; offered Leslie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No chance. They&#8217;ve all gone off to spend
the winter in California&mdash;every one. Ted had
a letter from Leroy Danforth, who is a great
chum of his, last week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I <i>know</i> there is some other explanation
besides a&mdash;a ghostly one!&#8221; declared Leslie,
nothing daunted. &#8220;But anyway, we might
have another look at the dragon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Phyllis went and got it out from its hiding-place
in her trunk, and they spent a fruitless
half-hour wrestling with its secret fastening.
They broke their finger-nails trying to pry it
open, they pressed and poked every inch of it
in an endeavor to find a possible secret spring;
they rattled and shook it, rewarded in this case
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
by the dull thud of something shifting about.
It was this last sound only that kept up their
courage. Finally they gave it up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe we could break it open with an
ax, perhaps; but you don&#8217;t seem to approve of
that, so how we&#8217;re ever going to find out, I&#8217;m
sure I can&#8217;t imagine!&#8221; declared Phyllis, discouraged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, I think this metal is so strong
it would resist even an ax,&#8221; Leslie soothed
her, &#8220;and we&#8217;d only damage the box without
accomplishing anything. There must be some
other way. Why not show it to Ted and your
father? Perhaps they could do what we
can&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will <i>not</i> share this secret with Ted!&#8221; declared
Phyllis, obstinately. &#8220;He&#8217;s nearly
nineteen and he thinks he&#8217;s the most important
thing in creation, and he&#8217;s perfectly insufferable
in some ways, now. To have his advice
asked in this thing would set him up worse
than ever. I won&#8217;t do it!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>Leslie had to smile inwardly at this outburst.
To her, Ted had seemed just a jolly, agreeable,
and rather companionable boy, with a
very friendly, likable attitude. But she realized
that she had not had Phyllis&#8217;s sisterly experience,
so she said nothing more. They put
the dragon back in his hiding-place and sadly
admitted themselves more baffled than ever.
</p>
<p>On the evening of the third day after this,
however, a strange thing happened.
</p>
<p>To the surprise of Leslie, Miss Marcia had
been induced to walk along the beach, after
supper, and stop in at Fisherman&#8217;s Luck to
hear a concert&mdash;an impromptu one&mdash;given by
Phyllis and her father and brother. Leslie had
learned that the Kelvin family amused itself in
this fashion every night when the fishing was
not particularly good.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to hear them play, shouldn&#8217;t you,
Aunt Marcia? Phyllis is a wonder, just by
herself, and they must make a delightful trio!&#8221;
She said this without any hope that her aunt
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
would express much interest; but to her astonishment,
Miss Marcia replied:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, suppose we walk down there after
tea. I&#8217;m feeling so much better that I don&#8217;t
believe it would hurt me, and I&#8217;m just hungry
to hear some music myself!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie joyfully imparted the news to Phyllis,
and they planned an elaborate program. It
was an evening that they long remembered,
so absorbed were they in the music that they
all loved. And it was not till the end of an
ensemble rendering of a Bach concerto, that
some one remarked, &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s raining!&#8221;
</p>
<p>No one had noticed it until then. Miss
Marcia was quite aghast, for she seldom ventured
out in the rain and she had brought no
adequate wraps. But Leslie settled that question
speedily. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take Rags and run up the
beach to our bungalow and bring them to you,
if Phyllis will lend me her slickers,&#8221; she declared.
&#8220;No, you mustn&#8217;t come with me, Ted.
I&#8217;ll be perfectly safe with Rags, and while
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
I&#8217;m gone, you can all be giving that Beethoven
sonata that you promised Aunt Marcia. I
won&#8217;t be fifteen minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They finally let her go and settled down to
the music once more. She was much more
than fifteen minutes in returning, but no one
noticed it, so deeply immersed were they in
the rendering of the sonata. At last, however,
she was back, breathless and dripping
and with a curious light in her eye that no one
noticed but Phyllis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Phyllis managed to whisper,
when the others were talking and putting on
wraps.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just this,&#8221; replied Leslie, breathlessly and
jerkily. &#8220;While I was in the house&mdash;I happened&mdash;to
look out of my window&mdash;as I often
do,&mdash;no light in my room&mdash;and I saw&mdash;that
light again next door! Rags saw it too&mdash;at
least he growled in that queer way. I waited
and watched a long time&mdash;I wanted to go out
nearer the place&mdash;but didn&#8217;t dare. Then it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
disappeared and I didn&#8217;t see it&mdash;any more.
Then I came on here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Phyllis listened to the whispered, jerky sentences
in a thrilled silence. Then she replied:
&#8220;I&#8217;m coming up first thing to-morrow morning&mdash;early!
But watch out the rest of the
night&mdash;if you can!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Phyllis was as good as her word&mdash;better, in
fact, for she was actually knocking at the door
of Rest Haven before Leslie was out of bed,
much to Miss Marcia&#8217;s astonishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see anything else?&#8221; was her first
whispered greeting.
</p>
<p>But Leslie shook her head. &#8220;There wasn&#8217;t
another thing happened. I watched nearly all
night&mdash;till I fell asleep at the window, in fact!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, something happened at <i>some</i> time or
other!&#8221; replied Phyllis, provocatively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; demanded Leslie, in
a twitter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen the sign of it. Come outside and
I&#8217;ll show you!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>They made some excuse to Miss Marcia for
immediately vacating the house, and hurried
outdoors. Phyllis led the way to a certain
side door of Curlew&#8217;s Nest, on the opposite
side from Rest Haven, where a sheltering projection
of roof extended out for two or three
feet over the ground. The hard rain of the
night before had beaten out the sand all about
the wooden foot-path to an unbroken smoothness.
But just under the protecting roof,
Phyllis pointed to something at their feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There it is!&#8221; she muttered. And Leslie,
staring down, beheld the impression of a single
footprint&mdash;a footprint very different from
either of their own&mdash;in the sand!
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>AN EXPLORING PARTY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; was Leslie&#8217;s first remark, &#8220;that
proves <i>one</i> thing beyond a doubt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; demanded Phyllis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That it wasn&#8217;t a <i>ghost</i> around here. I
never yet heard of a ghost who made a footprint!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The deduction somewhat staggered Phyllis
in her pet belief. &#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s true,&#8221;
she had to admit. &#8220;I never did, either. But
now the question is, who did it and what did
he want?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Leslie had been carefully examining the
footprint. &#8220;You say, what did &#8216;he&#8217; want.
Have you noticed that this footprint doesn&#8217;t
look very much like a <i>man&#8217;s</i>?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>Phyllis stooped over it. &#8220;You&#8217;re right!
It&#8217;s a woman&#8217;s or a girl&#8217;s. Here&#8217;s the deep
imprint of the little French heel, and the narrow,
pointed toe. Must have a mighty small
foot!&#8221; She measured her own beside it.
&#8220;Still, even mine would look much smaller in
pumps or slippers instead of these comfortable
sneakers. Might be either a small
woman or a girl like ourselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why is there only <i>one</i>, I wonder?&#8221;
mused Leslie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the answer to that is simple. She
walked on this narrow board-walk up from
the back road, probably because it was easier,
or, even perhaps, so as not to make any footprints.
And just at the doorstep she may
have stumbled, or stepped off by mistake in
the darkness. Perhaps she didn&#8217;t even realize
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Leslie had bent over the footprint.
&#8220;She was coming in when she made it. Do
you notice that it points toward the door?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>Phyllis stared at her. &#8220;What a perfectly
dandy detective you&#8217;d make!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;You simply take in everything!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just as good and even better!&#8221;
laughed Leslie, secretly pleased, however.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah for us!&#8221; cried Phyllis. &#8220;We&#8217;re
just a pair of natural <i>Sherlock Holmeses</i>!
Now, here&#8217;s what I propose. There&#8217;s something
mighty queer going on here, I believe.
And I&#8217;m willing to give up my ghost theory,
because it <i>does</i> seem silly. But I want to investigate
the thing pretty thoroughly, and the
only way to do it is to get into that bungalow
and see what has been going on inside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Phyllis!&#8221; cried the shocked Leslie.
&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t break into some one else&#8217;s
bungalow, would you? And besides, how
<i>could</i> you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; declared Phyllis, in scorn. &#8220;As if
I didn&#8217;t know this bungalow as well as our
own, and the Danforths almost as well as my
own family, too, for that matter. I&#8217;ve been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
in here a thousand times. The Danforths
would be only too grateful to me for keeping
an eye on their place for them. They&#8217;d do
the same for us. And as for getting in&mdash;why,
I&#8217;ve always known a private way of getting in
when everything&#8217;s locked up. The Danforths
themselves showed me. We&#8217;ll get in this afternoon.
This morning I promised Ted and
Father I&#8217;d fish with them awhile; but this afternoon
I&#8217;m free.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you two girls?&#8221; they heard Miss
Crane calling from next door, and they started
guiltily, not realizing how long they had been
away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must be more careful, or Aunt Marcia
will begin to suspect something and question
me,&#8221; whispered Leslie. &#8220;It would never do
in the world to have her realize there was anything
queer going on so close to us. She&#8217;d
pack up for home in a minute, her nerves are
still so uncertain. Coming, Aunt Marcia!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so!&#8221; agreed Phyllis. &#8220;Between
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
keeping it from your aunt and from Ted and
Father, we&#8217;re going to have some tight
squeezes, I foresee! Well, I&#8217;ll be back after
luncheon and we&#8217;ll do a bit of investigating.
Good-by!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was between half past one and two, that
afternoon, when Phyllis again appeared at
Rest Haven&mdash;a very auspicious time, for Miss
Marcia was in her room taking her usual long
nap and Ted and his father had gone a mile or
more down the beach to an inlet to try the fishing
there. The two girls had the whole vicinity
to themselves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall we do with Rags?&#8221; questioned
Phyllis. &#8220;I hardly think we ought to take him
in. Can&#8217;t you chain him up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t dare! He&#8217;d howl himself
sick and wake Aunt Marcia. You see, he&#8217;s
never chained. But I can turn him loose on
the beach and let him chase hermit-crabs, and
when he&#8217;s well occupied, we can slip away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They strolled down to the water&#8217;s edge with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
the dog, who was speedily absorbed in the one
occupation he found of never-failing interest.
Then they slipped back to the bungalow without
his even noticing that they had gone.
</p>
<p>It was only when they stood by the side door
of Curlew&#8217;s Nest that Leslie noticed something
bulky concealed under Phyllis&#8217;s sweater.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the world have you got there?&#8221; she
demanded.
</p>
<p>Phyllis produced a large-sized electric torch.
&#8220;How do you suppose we are going to see anything
in that dark place without something
like this? We certainly mustn&#8217;t open any
windows.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie confessed she hadn&#8217;t thought of it,
and then watched with amazement while
Phyllis skilfully inserted the blade of a knife
in the crack of the door, wiggled it about a moment,
and triumphantly lifted the hook inside
from its ring and swung open the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry in!&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;We must
close this quickly before any one can notice.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>They shut the door in haste, and Phyllis
flashed on her light. Then she replaced the
hook in its ring. &#8220;Now we&#8217;re safe! You see,
this is a little side-closet like a pantry, where
the ice-box is kept. They had the door made
so that the ice need not be carried in through
the kitchen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s a very poor catch for the door&mdash;just
that little hook!&#8221; cried Leslie. &#8220;I
should think they&#8217;d have something more secure
than that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it is,&#8221; agreed Phyllis, &#8220;and
they&#8217;ve often said so themselves. And yet
it&#8217;s just one of those things that never gets
changed. Anyhow, nobody ever locks anything
down here, only fastens things up when
the season is over. There&#8217;s really nothing
valuable enough here to lock up or to be attractive
to thieves. And so it has just gone
on, and I suppose that hook will remain there
forever! But come along! Let&#8217;s get down
to business. This way to the living-room!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
and she led the way along a passage and into
the big main room of the bungalow.
</p>
<p>It was very much on the style of that of
Rest Haven, furnished with attractive willow
furniture, and with a large brick open fireplace
at one side. As Phyllis flashed the torch about
in a general survey, Leslie noticed that the
cottage was obviously dismantled for the winter.
The furniture stood huddled against the
walls; there were no dainty draperies at the
shuttered windows, and the rugs were rolled
up, tied, and heaped in one corner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing seems out of the way here,&#8221; said
Phyllis. &#8220;It&#8217;s just as the Danforths usually
leave it. Now let&#8217;s look into the bedrooms.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They journeyed through the four bedrooms
with no different result. Each wore the same
undisturbed air of being shorn of its summer
drapery, with beds starkly stripped of all but
their mattresses, and these covered with heavy
paper. Then on into the kitchen, which
seemed, of all the rooms, to wear more nearly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
its normal aspect. But even there everything,
apparently, appeared as it should.
</p>
<p>It was in the kitchen that Phyllis stopped
short and faced Leslie. &#8220;Well, doesn&#8217;t it beat
everything!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;After all we&#8217;ve
seen and heard,&mdash;yes, and <i>found</i>,&mdash;there&#8217;s not
a thing here that looks as if a living soul had
been in it since Mrs. Danforth closed it up.
Now what do you make of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we haven&#8217;t looked closely enough.
Let&#8217;s go over it again,&#8221; was all Leslie could
offer. &#8220;And isn&#8217;t it possible that a person
might come in here for some reason and not
disturb anything?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course it&#8217;s possible, but is it likely?&#8221;
countered Phyllis. &#8220;But as you say, we&#8217;d better
go over the place again and more carefully.
If we don&#8217;t find <i>something</i>, I shall certainly
go back to believing in my &#8216;ghost.&#8217; And I
guess you&#8217;ll admit I have foundation for it
now!&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_2' id='linki_2'></a>
<img src='images/image-062.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<span class='caption'>
Phyllis flashed the torch about in a general survey
<br />
</span>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I tell you what!&#8221; suggested Leslie. &#8220;Suppose
we each take a turn with the flash-light
and go over every room twice, first you, then
myself. I noticed that, when you held the
light, I had to follow behind and look over
your shoulder or get in your way, and I really
couldn&#8217;t see very well. Now, I&#8217;ll sit in this
chair while you go over the place, and then you
give the torch to me. How does that strike
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good idea! You&#8217;re full of &#8217;em, Leslie.
I ought to have thought of it before.&#8221; And
while Leslie sat down rather gingerly in one
of the willow rockers against the wall, Phyllis
systematically examined the room again, diving
into all the nooks and corners, and at last
came back to hand the torch to her friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No luck! It&#8217;s as clean as a whistle of any
clues, as far as I can see. You take your
turn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When Leslie had completed her search, they
proceeded to treat the other rooms in similar
fashion, and so had come to the last bedroom
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
when they were startled by a sound from outside
the house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the world is <i>that</i>?&#8221; cried Phyllis,
in a panic. &#8220;It&#8217;s the most uncanny sound I
ever heard!&#8221; They listened again and caught
the intonation of a long moan, ending in a rising
note like a wail. It was truly a little hair-raising
in the closed, forsaken spot.
</p>
<p>Suddenly Leslie giggled. &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s only
Rags! He&#8217;s missed me at last, traced me
here, and is probably sitting by that side door
now, protesting against having been deserted!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Phyllis was both relieved at the explanation
and annoyed at the interruption. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go
and stop him right away, or he&#8217;ll have all the
neighborhood here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They hurried to the little side door in the
pantry and snapped off their light. Rags,
from the outside, sniffing at the threshold,
sensed their approach and yapped joyously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how are you going to lock that door
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
after you?&#8221; whispered Leslie, in sudden terror.
&#8220;It isn&#8217;t possible!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust me!&#8221; smiled the capable Phyllis.
&#8220;Do you suppose I&#8217;d have unfastened it if I
couldn&#8217;t fasten it up again? I just keep the
hook in a certain position with my knife, as I
close the door, and then gently drop it into the
ring through the crack. I&#8217;ve done it a dozen
times. Leroy Danforth taught us how.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie breathed a sigh of relief, and Phyllis
cautiously opened the door.
</p>
<p>Then both girls started back in genuine dismay!
</p>
<p>Sitting cross-legged in the sand, directly in
front of the door and holding back the delighted
Rags by his collar, was&mdash;of all people
most unwelcome to Phyllis&mdash;her grinning
brother Ted!
</p>
<p>The consternation of the guilty pair was almost
ludicrous, at least Ted found it so. Then
Phyllis recovered her self-possession and demanded:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What are <i>you</i> doing here, I&#8217;d like to
know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, ma&#8217;am, that&#8217;s a question I prefer
to ask of you&mdash;and with a great deal more
reason!&#8221; returned Ted. &#8220;Of all the nervy
things I ever saw, it&#8217;s you prowling around
the Danforths&#8217; closed bungalow and sneaking
out like a thief when you thought no one was
around!&#8221; Leslie felt herself turn red and uncomfortable
at the accusation, but Phyllis
seemed in no wise daunted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess if I want to show the place to Leslie,
there isn&#8217;t any particular harm in it.
She&#8217;s been asking me what it looked like in
there and how it differed from their house.
You know perfectly well, the Danforths
wouldn&#8217;t care a brass farthing!&#8221; This statement
happened to be entirely true, for Leslie
<i>had</i> questioned her only the day before as to
the interior arrangements and expressed some
curiosity to see it. She breathed a sigh of relief
at the ease with which Phyllis seemed to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
be explaining a rather peculiar situation.
</p>
<p>Ted, however, seemed only half convinced.
&#8220;If that&#8217;s so, it&#8217;s mighty queer that you
looked so guilty and caught-in-the-act-y when
you came out and saw me! And for goodness
sake, how long have you been in there, anyway?
This Rags dog came running up the
beach to us at least an hour ago. And I
thought, of course, you girls were somewhere
about. But when you didn&#8217;t appear after a
while, I began to get worried, and Rags and
I started off to find you. He led me straight
here (good old chap!) and we&#8217;ve been sitting
waiting at least fifteen minutes. Then he began
to howl and gave the game away. Now
please explain all this!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll explain nothing further,&#8221; replied
Phyllis, loftily, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll trouble you to tend
to your own affairs in the future!&#8221; With
which crushing rejoinder she marched away,
dragging the unhappy Leslie after her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right! Just you wait! I&#8217;ll dig out
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
your little secret!&#8221; he called after them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And he will, too!&#8221; muttered Phyllis.
&#8220;That is, if we don&#8217;t use the greatest caution.
Isn&#8217;t it unfortunate that that wretched dog
led him right here! However, I&#8217;ve settled him
for the present, and now let&#8217;s think about other
things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But it was not so easy for Leslie to forget
the unpleasantness of the recent encounter and
the implication that she had been caught trespassing.
But Phyllis settled down to steady
talk about their investigations and she presently
forgot the impression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mighty strange that in all our careful
search we didn&#8217;t find a single thing that would
indicate a recent visitor,&#8221; mused Phyllis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you see anything&mdash;any <i>least</i> little
thing?&#8221; questioned Leslie.
</p>
<p>Phyllis stared at her in some surprise.
&#8220;Why, you <i>know</i> I didn&#8217;t! What makes you
ask?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I <i>did</i>!&#8221; Leslie quietly returned.

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>LESLIE MAKES SOME DEDUCTIONS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Well, of all things!&#8221; ejaculated the
astonished Phyllis. &#8220;And you never
said a word! What was it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say anything,&#8221; explained Leslie,
&#8220;because there was hardly a chance. It was
just before we came out. And&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what was it? Never mind how it happened!&#8221;
cried Phyllis impatiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is part of it. In that southwest
bedroom (the one facing our house), I saw a
tiny string of beads lying under the bureau,
just by the front leg of it. The string was
just a thread about three inches long, with
some little green beads on it. A few of the
beads had come off it and rolled farther away.
I picked one of them up, and here it is.&#8221; She
held out a little bead to Phyllis.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But what on earth is there to <i>this</i>?&#8221; exclaimed
Phyllis, staring at it disappointedly.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what an insignificant little object
like this proves. It was probably left by the
Danforths, anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think it was,&#8221; returned Leslie,
quietly, &#8220;because the Danforths seem to have
cleaned the place very thoroughly. The rest
of the floor was spick and span as could be.
I think the string of beads was part of a fringe,
such as they wear so much nowadays to trim
nice dresses. It probably caught in the leg of
that bureau and was pulled off without its
owner realizing it. Now did any of the Danforths,
as far as you know, have any bead-trimmed
dresses that they wore down here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Phyllis shook her head. &#8220;I begin to see
what you&#8217;re driving at, Leslie. No, there&#8217;s
only Mrs. Danforth to wear dresses&mdash;the rest
of the family consists of her husband and the
boys. I&#8217;m perfectly certain I never saw her
in a beaded dress. And even if she had one,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
I&#8217;m sure she wouldn&#8217;t think of wearing it
down here, not even to travel home in. People
don&#8217;t bring elaborate clothes to this place, and
she&#8217;s never been known to. I believe you&#8217;re
right. If the beads had been there when the
place was cleaned, they would have disappeared.
They must have come there since.
The mysterious &#8216;she&#8217; of the footprint must have
left them! But what else was there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I noticed another thing that was curious
and very puzzling. I confess, I can&#8217;t
make much out of it, and yet it may mean a
great deal. It was out by the fireplace in the
living-room. Did you happen to notice that
one of the bricks in the floor of it looked as if
an attempt had been made to pry it loose, or
something? The cement all along one side
had been loosened and then packed down into
place again. And &#8217;way in the corner, I picked
up <i>this</i>!&#8221; She held up the blade of a penknife,
broken off halfway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I hadn&#8217;t noticed it at all!&#8221; exclaimed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
Phyllis, ruefully. &#8220;The truth is, Leslie, I
went into that place expecting to see it all torn
up or upheaved or something of the kind&mdash;something
very definite, anyway. And when
I didn&#8217;t find anything of the sort, I was awfully
disappointed and hardly stopped to notice
any of these small things. But I believe
what you&#8217;ve found may be very important,
and I think you&#8217;re awfully clever to have noticed
them, too. Why, it actually sounds like
a regular detective story! And now that
you&#8217;ve found these things, what do you make
out of them? Have you any ideas?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie wrinkled her brows for an interval
in silent thought. At last she said, &#8220;Yes, I
have a good many ideas, but I haven&#8217;t had
time to get them into any order yet. They&#8217;re
all sort of&mdash;chaotic!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, never mind!&#8221; cried the ever-impatient
Phyllis. &#8220;Tell me them, anyway. I don&#8217;t
care how chaotic they are!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, to begin with,&mdash;has this occurred to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
you?&mdash;whoever comes here selects only a
stormy, rainy night for a visit. Now <i>why</i>,
unless they think it the best kind of time to
escape observation. They just calculate on
few people going out or even <i>looking</i> out of
their houses on that kind of a night. Isn&#8217;t
that so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly seems to be,&#8221; agreed Phyllis,
&#8220;but what do you prove by that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t <i>prove</i> anything, but I&#8217;ve drawn a
conclusion from it that I&#8217;ll tell you later.
Then, there&#8217;s the matter of this little bead.
I know you rather scorned it when I first
showed it to you, but do you realize one thing?
We may be able to identify the owner by
means of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Phyllis stared at her incredulously, but Leslie
continued: &#8220;Yes, I really think so, and
I&#8217;ll tell you why. This isn&#8217;t an ordinary bead.
In the first place, it&#8217;s a rather peculiar shade
of green&mdash;one you don&#8217;t ordinarily see. Then,
though it&#8217;s so small, it&#8217;s cut in a different way,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
too, sort of melon-shaped, only with about six
sides. Do you see?&#8221;
</p>
<p>On closer examination, Phyllis did see.
And she had to acknowledge that Leslie was
right.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s the broken penknife and the
brick with one side pried out,&#8221; went on Leslie.
&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty plain that the person was trying
to pry up that brick with the penknife and
found it hard work because the mortar or cement
is solid. Then the blade of the knife
broke and the attempt was probably given up.
Now why did they want to pry up that brick?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know!&mdash;I know!&#8221; cried Phyllis, triumphantly.
&#8220;They wanted to bury &#8216;The Dragon&#8217;s
Secret&#8217; under it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they did and maybe they didn&#8217;t,&#8221;
replied Leslie, more cautiously. &#8220;They certainly
tried to pry up the brick, but perhaps
it was to <i>look</i> for something under it, rather
than to hide anything. However, I rather
think it was to hide it. And because they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
didn&#8217;t succeed, they went out and buried it
in the sand, instead. How about <i>that</i>?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Phyllis sprang up and hugged her impetuously.
&#8220;You have a brain like a regulation
sleuth-hound&#8217;s!&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;What else?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is what I can&#8217;t understand.
Suppose this person (we&#8217;re sure now it must
be a woman) came down here that first stormy
night with &#8216;The Dragon&#8217;s Secret,&#8217; and tried
to hide it somewhere, and finally buried it in
the sand outside. The question is, what did
she come for the <i>second</i> time?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To get it again?&#8221; suggested Phyllis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m almost absolutely certain not, because,
if so, all she would have had to do was to go
outside and dig. (Of course, she wouldn&#8217;t
have found it because we had it!) But she
never went outside at all. I know that positively.
I passed right by the place where
Rags dug the hole, on my way up from your
bungalow, and it was quite untouched, just
as we left it after we filled it up again that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
day. And when we came back again, I looked
a second time, and still it was the same. And
I watched half the night and would certainly
have seen if any one had gone there. No, I&#8217;m
sure it wasn&#8217;t for that. But what was it for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it up,&#8221; advised Phyllis, &#8220;at least for
the present. Anything else?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, except the conclusion I drew about the
person&#8217;s coming on a stormy night. Do you
realize this?&mdash;there&#8217;s quite a big chance that
they&mdash;or rather, <i>she</i>!&mdash;will come again on the
<i>next</i> stormy night&mdash;perhaps!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if that&#8217;s the case,&#8221; exclaimed Phyllis,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve drawn a little conclusion of my own.
The next stormy night I&#8217;m going to spend at
your bungalow&mdash;and we&#8217;re going to keep
awake all night!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>A NEW DEVELOPMENT</h3>
</div>

<p>But the weather remained quite clear for
several nights after this. And meantime
other things happened that gave a new twist to
the girls&#8217; conjectures.
</p>
<p>Two mornings after the events of the last
chapter, Phyllis appeared at Rest Haven with
a mysterious wrapped parcel in her hand.
Answering Leslie&#8217;s curious glance, she whispered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to take this thing and keep it
here and hide it. It&#8217;s &#8216;The Dragon&#8217;s Secret.&#8217;
I don&#8217;t feel safe a minute with it around our
place since Ted&#8217;s performance the other day.
You know, he boasted he&#8217;d find out our secret,
and he will certainly make every effort
to, or I don&#8217;t know him. Whether he&#8217;ll succeed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
or not depends upon how clever <i>we</i> are in
spoiling his plans. If he found this, though,
we might as well not try to keep the rest from
him. I discovered him snooping around my
room rather suspiciously yesterday. This was
locked up in my trunk, and he <i>said</i> he was only
hunting for fudge! But anyhow, you&#8217;d better
keep it now, if you can think of some safe
place to hide it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know where to put it!&#8221;
sighed Leslie, rather worried by the responsibility.
&#8220;Aunt Marcia and I shared one big
trunk because it didn&#8217;t seem worth while to
bring two, when one needs so few things here.
So of course I couldn&#8217;t put it in there, and the
lock of my suitcase is broken. There isn&#8217;t
a bureau-drawer with a key in the whole
bungalow&mdash;so what am I going to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a time, Phyllis was equally puzzled.
Then suddenly she had a bright idea. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
tell you! That top shelf in your pantry where
the refrigerator is! You said you&#8217;d put quite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
a few kitchen things that you didn&#8217;t use there,
and it&#8217;s dark and unhandy and neither your
aunt nor any one else would think of disturbing
it. Wouldn&#8217;t that be the best place, really?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right,&#8221; admitted Leslie, considerably
relieved. &#8220;Wait till Aunt Marcia
has gone to sit on the front veranda, and we
can put it there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Dragon&#8217;s Secret had probably known
some strange resting-places in its time, but
doubtless none stranger than the one in which
it now found itself&mdash;a dark, rather dusty top
shelf in a pantry, hobnobbing with a few worn-out
pots and pans and discarded kitchen-ware!
But the girls tucked it far into a corner, and,
wrapped in its burlap bag, it was as successfully
concealed as it would have been in a
strong-box.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, there&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been
wanting to ask you,&#8221; said Leslie, as the two
girls strolled down to the beach. &#8220;Do you
happen to know anything about the people
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
who hired Curlew&#8217;s Nest the latter part of this
summer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; answered Phyllis, &#8220;though I
didn&#8217;t happen to see them myself. Mrs. Danforth
told me that in July the Remsons had it,
as they always do. But in August and September
she rented it to an elderly gentleman,&mdash;I
can&#8217;t think of his name, just this minute,&mdash;who
stayed there all by himself, with only his
man or valet to do all the work. He wasn&#8217;t
very well,&mdash;was recovering from some kind of
a fever, I think,&mdash;and wanted to be alone in
some quiet place. You know, Mrs. Danforth
herself spent all summer in your bungalow,
and she said she saw very little of the man in
Curlew&#8217;s Nest, though they were such near
neighbors. He sat on his porch or in the house
a great deal, or took long walks by himself
on the beach. He used to pass the time of day
with her, and make some other formal remarks,
but that was about all. She was really rather
curious about him, he seemed so anxious not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
to mix with other people or be talked to. But
he left about the middle of September, and
she closed up that bungalow for the winter.
That&#8217;s about all I know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad you can&#8217;t think of his name!&#8221;
exclaimed Leslie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; demanded Phyllis, suddenly curious.
&#8220;You surely don&#8217;t think that has anything
to do with <i>this</i> affair, do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Leslie countered that question by asking
another: &#8220;Has it ever occurred to you
as strange, Phyllis, that whoever got into that
bungalow lately, knew the little secret about
the side door and worked it so cleverly?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Phyllis&#8217;s eyes grew wide and she seized Leslie&#8217;s
arm in so muscular a grip that Leslie
winced. &#8220;No, it didn&#8217;t, you little pocket-edition
<i>Sherlock Holmes</i>! But I see what
you&#8217;re driving at. To know about that side
door, one must have been pretty well acquainted
with that bungalow&mdash;<i>lived</i> in it for a
while! Aha! No wonder you&#8217;re curious
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
about the last occupant. We&#8217;ll have to count
that old gentleman in on this!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but here&#8217;s the mystery,&#8221; reminded
Leslie. &#8220;You said he lived here alone except
for his man-servant. Remember, please, that
the footprint we saw&mdash;was a <i>woman&#8217;s</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Phyllis tore at her hair in mock despair.
&#8220;Worse and more of it!&#8221; she groaned. &#8220;But
the deeper it gets, the more determined I
grow to get to the bottom of it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They strolled on a while in silence. Suddenly
Phyllis asked, &#8220;Where&#8217;s Rags this morning?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t seem to feel very well to-day.
Something seems to have disagreed with him&mdash;perhaps
too many hermit-crabs! Anyway,
he&#8217;s lying around on the veranda and seems to
want to stay near Aunt Marcia and sleep.
She said she&#8217;d keep him there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Best news I&#8217;ve heard in an age!&#8221; exclaimed
Phyllis, delightedly. &#8220;That dog is a
most faithful article, Leslie, but he&#8217;s a decided
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
nuisance sometimes! And now, I have
a gorgeous idea that I&#8217;ve been wanting to try
for two days. Father and Ted have gone off
for the day up the inlet, and Rags is out of
commission. Here&#8217;s our chance. Do you
realize that there&#8217;s one bedroom in Curlew&#8217;s
Nest we didn&#8217;t have a chance to explore the
other day? Let&#8217;s go and do it right now.
I&#8217;ll run down to our house for the electric
torch and meet you at the side door. There&#8217;s
not a soul around to interfere with us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Phyllis! I really don&#8217;t think we
ought&mdash;&#8221; objected Leslie, recalling all too
vividly the unpleasantness of their former experience.
But Phyllis was off and far away
while she was still expostulating, and in the
end, Leslie found herself awaiting her companion
in the vicinity of the side door of Curlew&#8217;s
Nest.
</p>
<p>They entered the dark bungalow with beating
hearts, more aware this time than ever that
mystery lurked in the depth of it. Straight
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
to the unexplored bedroom they proceeded,
for, as Leslie reminded them, they had no time
to waste; Rags might have an untimely recovery
and come seeking them as before! Ted
also might be prompted by his evil genius to
descend on them; or even Aunt Marcia might
be minded to hunt them up.
</p>
<p>The bedroom in question, as Phyllis now recalled,
was the southwest one, and the one
Mrs. Danforth said that the last tenant had chosen
for his own. &#8220;Therefore it ought to be more
than ordinarily interesting,&#8221; went on Phyllis.
&#8220;I remember now that Mrs. Danforth
said he had asked permission to leave there,
as a little contribution to the bungalow, a
few books that he had finished with and
did not wish to carry away. She left
them right where they were on a shelf in his
room, instead of putting them in the bookcase
in the living-room. I&#8217;m sort of remembering
these things she told me, piecemeal, because
Mrs. Danforth is a great talker and is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
always giving you a lot of details about things
you&#8217;re not particularly interested in, and you
try to listen politely, but often find it an awful
bore. Then you try to forget it all as soon as
possible!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They found the bedroom in question somewhat
more spacious and better furnished than
the others. But though they examined every
nook and cranny with care, they discovered
nothing thrilling, or even enlightening, within
its walls till they came to the shelf of books.
These, with the exception of two books of recent
fiction, were all of travel and politics in
foreign countries.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My, but he must have been interested in
India and China and Tibet and those countries!&#8221;
exclaimed Leslie, reading the titles.
&#8220;I wonder why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She took one of them down and turned the
pages idly. As she did so, something fluttered
out and fell to the floor. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; she
cried, picking it up and examining it. &#8220;Phyllis,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
this may prove very valuable! Do you see
what it is?&#8221; It was an envelop of thin, foreign-looking
paper&mdash;an empty envelop, forgotten
and useless, unless perhaps it had been
employed as a bookmark. But on it was a
name&mdash;the name no doubt of the recipient of
the letter it had once contained, and also a
foreign address.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see what it says?&#8221; went on Leslie,
excitedly. &#8220;&#8216;<i>Honorable Arthur Ramsay</i>,
<i>Hotel des Wagons-Lits</i>, <i>Peking</i>&#8217;. Why,
Phyllis, that&#8217;s his name (which you couldn&#8217;t
remember!) and he was evidently at some time
in Peking!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Phyllis was puckering her brows in an
effort of memory. &#8220;There&#8217;s some mistake
here, I guess,&#8221; she remarked at length, &#8220;for
now I recall that Mrs. Danforth said his name
was Mr. Horatio Gaines!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie dropped the envelop back in the
book, the picture of disappointment. &#8220;It
doesn&#8217;t seem likely he&#8217;d have someone else&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
envelops in his books,&#8221; she remarked. &#8220;And
I think Honorable Arthur Ramsay of Peking
sounds far more thrilling than plain &#8216;Horatio
Gaines&#8217;! Let&#8217;s look through the rest of the
books and see if we can discover anything else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They examined them all, but found nothing
more of interest and Leslie suggested uneasily
that they had better go.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s one thing I must see first,&mdash;&#8221;
decided Phyllis; &#8220;the beads and broken penknife
you found. I&#8217;ve been wild to look at
them for myself. Come along! We&#8217;ll have
time for that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They made their way cautiously into the
next bedroom, bent down, and turned the torch
toward the floor under the bureau where Leslie
had made the discovery. Then both girls simultaneously
gasped. There was not a sign of
the beads anywhere to be seen!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Phyllis!&#8221; breathed Leslie, in frightened
wonder. &#8220;It&#8217;s gone&mdash;the whole string!
What can be the meaning of it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; cried Phyllis, dragging Leslie after
her. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go and see if the broken penknife
blade is there yet. If that&#8217;s gone, too,
something new has happened here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They hurried to the living-room and bent
over the fireplace. The half-loosened brick
was there as Leslie had described it, but of the
broken penknife blade in the corner, there was
not a vestige to be seen!

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE CLUE OF THE GREEN BEAD</h3>
</div>

<p>With shaking knees and blank dismay
on their faces, they crept out of Curlew&#8217;s
Nest and fastened the door. Then they
hurried down to the water&#8217;s edge and sat on a
rise of sand to talk it over.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can it all mean, Phyllis?&#8221; quavered
Leslie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It means that some one has been in there
again since day before yesterday,&#8221; declared
her companion, &#8220;though it&#8217;s been bright moonlight
for the past two nights, and how they got
in without being seen, I can&#8217;t quite understand!
You said you kept some sort of watch,
didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly did. I haven&#8217;t gone to bed till
late, and every once in a while during the night,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
I&#8217;ve waked up and looked over there. It
doesn&#8217;t seem possible they would dare to
come with the moonlight bright as day, all
night long. Of course, that side door is on the
opposite side from us, and the only way I could
tell would be by seeing a light through the
cracks of the shutter. Perhaps if they hadn&#8217;t
had a very bright light, I wouldn&#8217;t know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what did they come for?&#8221; questioned
Phyllis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s simple. They came back to
get the beads and the knife-blade. Probably
it was the &#8216;mysterious she,&#8217; and she came to
get those things because she realized they&#8217;d
been left there and might be discovered by
some one else. What else could it be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you must be right,&#8221; agreed Phyllis.
&#8220;But it&#8217;s the queerest thing I ever heard
of! Anyway, there&#8217;s <i>one</i> thing the lady
doesn&#8217;t know&mdash;that we have still one of the
beads! I wonder how she&#8217;d feel if she <i>did</i>
realize it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you ever wonder what that mysterious
lady is like?&#8221; asked Leslie. &#8220;I often try to
picture her&mdash;from the very, very little we know
about her. I think she is tall and dark and
slender, and very, very stylishly dressed. She
has rather sad brown eyes and is quite foreign-looking
and would be very interesting to
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t imagine her that way at all,&#8221;
replied Phyllis. &#8220;To me it seems as if she
must be large and imposing, with light hair and
blue eyes and very quick, vivacious manners.
I agree that she is no doubt dressed in a very
up-to-date style, and is probably about thirty-five
or forty years old. I don&#8217;t know whether
I&#8217;d like to know her or not, but I <i>would</i> like
to know what she&#8217;s after in that bungalow!&#8221;
</p>
<p>So they continued to conjecture and imagine
till Phyllis finally exclaimed: &#8220;Why, there
are Father and Ted back already! Fishing
must have been poor this morning. Thank
goodness we got out of that place when we did!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
But that reminds me, I ought to go to the village
and order some supplies. The grocer
doesn&#8217;t come here again for two days. Don&#8217;t
you want to walk down with me? It&#8217;s a gorgeous
morning for a &#8216;hike&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I will,&#8221; agreed Leslie, &#8220;that is,
if Aunt Marcia can get along without me.
I haven&#8217;t had a good walk in so long that I
fairly ache for one. I&#8217;ll go and see if Aunt
Marcia would like me to get her anything,
and I&#8217;ll meet you in five minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was indeed a glorious morning for a walk.
The crisp October air was as clear as crystal
and the salt meadows back of the dunes were
still gay with goldenrod and the deeper autumn
colorings. The creek that wound through
them was a ribbon of intense blue, and a thousand
marsh-birds twittered and darted and
swooped over its surface. But the two girls
were, for once, almost blind to the beauty of it
all, so absorbed were they in the never-failing
topic of their mystery. And the village was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
reached almost before they realized they were
in its vicinity.
</p>
<p>Phyllis did her shopping first, in the general
grocery store. Then Leslie suggested that
they visit the little fancy-goods store and look
up some wool for Miss Marcia&#8217;s knitting. It
was a very tiny little store, kept by a tiny,
rather sleepy old lady, who took a long time
to find the articles her customers required. It
seemed as if she would never, never locate the
box with the right shade of wool in it!
</p>
<p>While they were waiting, not altogether patiently,
a handsome automobile drew up in
front of the store. Its only occupant was a
young girl scarcely older than Leslie and Phyllis,
and by the ease with which she handled the
car, it was plain to be seen that she was an accomplished
driver. In another moment she
had entered the store and was standing beside
the two girls, waiting to be served.
</p>
<p>She was short and slender in build, with a
pink-and-white complexion, of marvelous clearness,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
and fluffy, red-brown hair. Under the
heavy coat which she had unbuttoned on entering
the store could be seen a stylish suit of
English tweeds, very tailor-made and up-to-date,
and a smart tam crowned her red-brown
hair.
</p>
<p>After the pleasant manner of the villagers
and accustomed summer people, Phyllis bade
her &#8220;Good morning!&#8221; But, to the astonishment
of both girls, instead of replying in an
equally pleasant manner, she stared at them
both up and down for a moment, then turned
away with only an ungracious nod. The indignant
pair left her severely alone after that,
except for a furtive glance or two when she was
looking the other way. But when they had
at last ascertained that old Mrs. Selby had,
after all, <i>no</i> wool of the shade required, Leslie
hurried Phyllis out with what seemed almost
unnecessary haste.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The little wretch!&#8221; sputtered Phyllis, once
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
safely outside. &#8220;Did you <i>ever</i> see worse manners?
But she&#8217;s&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind about her manners!&#8221; whispered
Leslie, excitedly. &#8220;Did you notice anything
else?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Noticed that she was very smart looking
and quite pretty&mdash;that is, I thought so at first.
But after she acted that way, she seemed positively
<i>hateful</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! I don&#8217;t mean that. Did you notice
anything about her dress&mdash;her clothes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, do tell me what you mean!&#8221; cried Phyllis.
&#8220;How you do love to mystify a person!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; whispered Leslie, her eyes still on
the door of the little store, &#8220;when she threw
open her coat I just happened to glance at her
dress, and noticed that it had a girdle of some
dark green, crêpe-y material, and the two ends
had fringes of beads&mdash;<i>and the beads were just
like the ones in Curlew&#8217;s Nest</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Phyllis simply stared at her, open-mouthed
and incredulous. &#8220;It can&#8217;t be!&#8221; she muttered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
at length. &#8220;Even if the beads were like the
ones you found&mdash;there are probably more persons
than one who have some like them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s true,&#8221; admitted Leslie, &#8220;but
the color&mdash;and queer shape&mdash;everything!&mdash;At
least, it&#8217;s something worth investigating. It&#8217;s
the first real clue we&#8217;ve had.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At that moment, the girl in question came
out of the store, sprang into the car, whirled
the wheel about, and was off down the street
in a cloud of dust. They stood gazing after
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem possible!&#8221; exclaimed Phyllis.
&#8220;It just can&#8217;t be! And yet&mdash;tell you
what! I&#8217;m just wondering whether she&#8217;s
staying anywhere around here or is just a casual
stranger passing through the town. Let&#8217;s
go in and ask old Mrs. Selby if she knows anything
about her. If she&#8217;s staying here, Mrs.
Selby will positively know it. I&#8217;ll make the
excuse of having forgotten to buy something.
Come along!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>She hustled Leslie back into the little shop
and soon had little Mrs. Selby hunting for a
size and variety of shell hair-pin of which she
had no need whatever, as she possessed already
a plentiful supply at home. But it was the
only thing she could think of at the moment.
When they were being wrapped, she asked
quite casually:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that young girl who just went out a
stranger here, Mrs. Selby, or is she stopping in
the village? Seems to me I don&#8217;t recall her
face.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she ain&#8217;t exactly a stranger,&#8221; replied
Mrs. Selby with alacrity, quite waking up at
the prospect of retailing a bit of gossip; &#8220;But
she ain&#8217;t been around here so long&mdash;only a
couple of weeks or so. She comes in here once
in a while, but she ain&#8217;t very friendly like&mdash;never
passes the time o&#8217; day nor nothing,&mdash;just
asks for what she wants and goes out. I
never did quite take to manners like that. Nobody
else here acts so&mdash;not even the summer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
folks. I can&#8217;t think how she was brung up!
They do say as she ain&#8217;t an American,&mdash;that
she&#8217;s English or something,&mdash;but I don&#8217;t
know for sure. Anyhow, she don&#8217;t mix with
no one&mdash;just runs around in that ottymobile
all the time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s she stopping?&#8221; went on Phyllis.
&#8220;The hotel is closed. I thought all the summer
people but ourselves had gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s boarding up to Aunt Sally
Blake&#8217;s. I dunno how she come to go there,
but there she is. I wonder how Aunt Sally
gets along with her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you heard what her name is?&#8221; pursued
Phyllis, as she received her parcel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They do say her name is Ramsay&mdash;Miss
Ramsay. Good morning, young ladies, and
thank you. Come in again soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When they were out on the street, Leslie
clutched Phyllis spasmodically and her eyes
were almost popping out of her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there the least doubt in your mind <i>now</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
Phyllis Kelvin?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;Her name
is Ramsay&mdash;the very same name that was on
the envelop in the book!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Phyllis was obliged to acknowledge
herself convinced.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>AUNT SALLY ADDS TO THE MYSTIFICATION</h3>
</div>

<p>THE two girls walked home in a state bordering
on stupefaction. Every little
while Phyllis would stop to ejaculate: &#8220;Who
would have thought it! The horrid little snob!
I really can&#8217;t believe yet that it is she, Leslie&mdash;our
&#8216;mysterious she!&#8217; I&#8217;m sure there must be
some mistake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course, it <i>may</i> not be so,&#8221; Leslie
admitted, &#8220;but you must see how many things
point to it. The beads are identical. I stood
so near her that I had a fine chance to see them
closely. Her name is the same as the one on
the envelop in the book&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but that isn&#8217;t the name of the man
who hired the bungalow,&#8221; objected Phyllis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s quite true, but even so, you can&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
tell what connection there may be with the
other name. It isn&#8217;t exactly a common one,
and that makes it all the more likely that we
may be right. And then, there&#8217;s the fact of
her being so near here&mdash;right in the village. I
have always imagined that whoever it was had
to come from quite a distance, and I&#8217;ve always
wondered how she managed it, so late at
night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Leslie, why on earth should she come
to that bungalow in the dead of night, in a
storm, and hide that &#8216;Dragon&#8217;s Secret&#8217;? What
mysterious affair can she be mixed up with,
anyway?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie, however, had no solution to offer to
this poser, but she did have a sudden idea that
made her stop short in the road and gasp:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you realize, Phyllis Kelvin, that we are
doing a very questionable&mdash;yes, a <i>wrong</i> thing
in keeping the &#8216;Dragon&#8217;s Secret,&#8217; when it evidently
belongs to this girl?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How do you <i>know</i> it belongs to this girl?&#8221;
countered Phyllis. &#8220;You only <i>guess</i> that it
may, when all&#8217;s said and done. You didn&#8217;t
see her hide it there&mdash;you didn&#8217;t even see <i>her</i>
at the bungalow. We may be way off the
track, for all you know, and we&#8217;d be a pretty
pair of geese to go and meekly hand it to her,
shouldn&#8217;t we! And do you know, even if I
was simply <i>positive</i> it was hers, I just
wouldn&#8217;t give it to her, anyway, for a while.
I&#8217;d let her stew and fret for it for a good long
spell&mdash;after such hatefulness!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Phyllis&#8217;s manner was so vindictive that Leslie
had to smile in spite of herself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But oh, see here!&#8221; Phyllis went on. &#8220;<i>I</i>
have an idea&mdash;a glorious idea! It may help
to clear up a lot of things. I know Aunt Sally
Blake very well, and we&#8217;ll go and see her&mdash;this
very afternoon! Perhaps she can give us
more light on the subject.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But wouldn&#8217;t that seem too plainly like
tracking down this&mdash;Miss Ramsay?&#8221; objected
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
Leslie, &#8220;especially as she doesn&#8217;t appear to
care for our acquaintance!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit!&#8221; declared Phyllis, positively.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t realize how well <i>I</i> know Aunt
Sally. Why, she&#8217;s a regular village institution&mdash;everybody
knows her and thinks the
world of her. She&#8217;s a plump, jolly, delightful
old lady who lives in a delightful old house
full of dear, old-fashioned furniture. She
keeps a lot of chickens and often sells them
and the fresh eggs, and she does a little sewing,
and sometimes takes a boarder or two, and goes
out nursing occasionally&mdash;and oh, I don&#8217;t know
what all! But I know that we couldn&#8217;t get
along at all around here without Aunt Sally.
We&#8217;ll go down to her house this afternoon and
call (I really haven&#8217;t been to see her since I
came down this time), and I&#8217;ll ask her if she
has a nice roasting chicken that I can have.
That&#8217;ll be a perfectly good excuse. And if
our polite young lady isn&#8217;t around, I&#8217;ll try
and get her to talk. Aunt Sally loves to talk,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
but she isn&#8217;t a gossip like old Mrs. Selby, and
we&#8217;ll have to go at it a little more carefully.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They solaced themselves with this thought,
and awaited with more than a little impatience
the visit that afternoon. Surely Aunt Sally,
if any one, would be able to solve some of their
mysteries!
</p>
<p>By afternoon, the weather had turned warm,
almost sultry, and they found Aunt Sally sitting
on her front porch, rocking gently and
humming to herself over her sewing. She was
delighted to see Phyllis again and to make the
acquaintance of Leslie, whom Phyllis introduced
as her neighbor and very dear friend.
When they had chatted about topics of common
interest for a while, Phyllis introduced
the subject of the chicken.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless your heart, dear!&#8221; cried Aunt Sally.
&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry, but I haven&#8217;t a roasting chicken
just now in the whole yard&mdash;nothing but
fowls. But I can give you a couple of nice
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
young broilers&mdash;and I&#8217;ve plenty of fresh
eggs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Phyllis straightway arranged to have two
broilers ready for her when she called for them
next day, and skilfully changed the subject.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Aunt Sally! do show Leslie those begonias
you&#8217;ve been raising all summer. I do
think they are the most beautiful things! You
certainly are very successful at making things
grow!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Highly flattered, Aunt Sally rose to lead
the girls indoors to the sunny room where she
kept her plants. While they were admiring
them, she asked them to sit down and rest a
while and talk&mdash;an invitation they accepted
with great alacrity. At length, after a detailed
account of the health and affairs of her
entire family, Phyllis craftily led the conversation
back to Aunt Sally herself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And are you alone now, Aunt Sally, or is
your sister still with you? I heard she was going
back to Ohio.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she&#8217;s gone and I&#8217;m alone,&#8221; sighed
Aunt Sally; &#8220;at least,&mdash;I&#8217;m not quite alone.
I have a boarder at present.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>have</i> you!&#8221; exclaimed Phyllis, guilefully,
as if it were all news to her. &#8220;Why,
that&#8217;s very nice. I hope the boarder will stay
a long while. It will be some company for
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I dunno how long she&#8217;ll stay, and
she ain&#8217;t much company for <i>me</i>, I must confess!&#8221;
admitted Aunt Sally, with a somewhat
worried air. &#8220;The truth is, I can&#8217;t exactly
make her out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was precisely the line that Phyllis
wished her to take, yet even now caution must
be observed or Aunt Sally might shy away
from it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s a lady then!&#8221; remarked the artful
Phyllis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no, it ain&#8217;t exactly a lady&mdash;it&#8217;s a
young girl &#8217;bout the age of you two, I should
guess.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Still, I don&#8217;t see why she shouldn&#8217;t be company
for you, even so,&#8221; argued Phyllis, quite
as if she were still completely in the dark as to
this new boarder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason she ain&#8217;t much company,&#8221; went
on Aunt Sally, &#8220;is because&mdash;well, I don&#8217;t
know as I ought to say it, but I guess she thinks
she&#8217;s too sort of&mdash;high-toned to &#8217;sociate with
the person who keeps her boarding-house!&#8221;
Aunt Sally laughed, an amused, throaty little
chuckle at this, and then the worried frown
came back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, she must be rather horrid, I think,&#8221;
commented Phyllis, with more heartfelt reason
than Aunt Sally could guess!
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think she means to be horrid&mdash;she&#8217;s
just been brought up that way, I guess.
I wish she could be more friendly. I sort of
feel a responsibility about her. You see, she&#8217;s
here all alone. She was staying at the hotel
with her grandfather, and he suddenly took
awful sick and had to be taken to the hospital
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
up at Branchville. She stayed on at the hotel
so&#8217;s to be near him (she runs up there every
day in her car), and then the hotel had to close
down for the season. The manager come to
me and asked me if I could take her in, &#8217;cause
he was kind of sorry for her, her grandfather
bein&#8217; so ill, an&#8217; she couldn&#8217;t seem to find no
other place. So I did, but she worries me a
lot, somehow. I don&#8217;t like to see a young girl
like that with no one to look after her, and she
running around loose in that auto all the time.
Why, she even took it out one rainy night last
week at ten o&#8217;clock. Said she was worried
about her grandfather, but I didn&#8217;t approve of
her running all the way up there to Branchville
in the rain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Here Phyllis glanced significantly at Leslie
and interjected a question. &#8220;Did she and her
grandfather have one of the bungalows on the
beach this summer, do you know, Aunt Sally?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, not that I know of. She said she&#8217;d
been visiting some friends somewhere in Maine,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
and then come on here to join her grandfather
just a few days before he was taken sick. I
don&#8217;t think it likely she ever stayed in one of
the bungalows. She didn&#8217;t seem to know anything
about this region at first. And I&#8217;d
likely have heard of it if she had. But, laws!
I got biscuits in the oven and I&#8217;m clean forgetting
them!&#8221; And with a whisk of skirts,
Aunt Sally vanished for a moment into the
kitchen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did I tell you!&#8221; whispered Leslie.
&#8220;Went out in the rain one night last week about
ten o&#8217;clock! I warrant she didn&#8217;t go to the
hospital, or, if she did, it was after she&#8217;d visited
Curlew&#8217;s Nest!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Aunt Sally was back almost immediately,
bearing some hot biscuits and jam which
she hospitably invited her guests to try. And
while they were partaking of this refreshment
she sighed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;My, how I have been gossiping about that
poor girl! I sort of feel conscience-stricken,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
for I could like her real well if she&#8217;d only let
me. She&#8217;s a sort of lovable-looking child! I
wish she knew you two girls. I believe it
would do her a lot of good to be around with
you. There she is now!&#8221;&mdash;she cried, as a car
flashed past the window and up the driveway
toward the barn. &#8220;Just wait till she comes in
and I&#8217;ll introduce you&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; exclaimed Phyllis, hastily springing
up. &#8220;Better not, Aunt Sally. If she
doesn&#8217;t care for you, I&#8217;m sure she wouldn&#8217;t for
us. Besides, we must go right away. Remember,
we&#8217;re both the <i>cooks</i> in our families,
and even as it is, we won&#8217;t be back very early.
It&#8217;s a long walk. Good-by, and thank you,
and I&#8217;ll send for the broilers to-morrow!&#8221;
And with Leslie in tow, she hurried away, leaving
a somewhat bewildered Aunt Sally gazing
after them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess not! The idea of trying to
get acquainted a second time with that difficult
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
young person!&#8221; Phyllis exploded, when they
were out of ear-shot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; mused Leslie as they swung
along, &#8220;unpleasant as the thought of it is, I
wonder if it wouldn&#8217;t be a good idea&mdash;to get
acquainted?&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>AT DAWN</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;How do you mean&mdash;it might be the best
thing to get acquainted with her?&#8221; demanded
Phyllis, indignantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, if we could do so in some way that
wasn&#8217;t like forcing ourselves on her, it might
lead to a good many things&mdash;solving our mystery
mainly. And then,&mdash;who knows?&mdash;she
<i>might</i> be pleasant when you come to know her
better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No chance!&#8221; declared Phyllis, and dismissed
that subject. &#8220;Well, Aunt Sally
didn&#8217;t do much toward clearing up things, did
she?&#8221; she went on. &#8220;I was in hopes she&#8217;d be
able to give us a good many more ideas. One
thing&#8217;s certain though. That girl evidently
came here in the car that rainy night, but&mdash;Look
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
here! Something strange has just occurred
to me&mdash;Aunt Sally didn&#8217;t say <i>which</i>
rainy night, and there have been two in the past
ten days. I judge that the girl must have
been with her for at least a couple of weeks,
for the hotel closed up more than two weeks
ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking of that, too,&#8221; replied
Leslie. &#8220;And, do you know, I&#8217;m almost certain
Aunt Sally must have meant the <i>last</i> one,
because she only said <i>&#8216;rainy&#8217;</i> night. If she&#8217;d
meant that other, wouldn&#8217;t she have said &#8216;the
night of the hard storm,&#8217; or something like
that? Because it really <i>was</i> unusual, and if
this Miss Ramsay had gone out <i>that</i> night, I
believe Aunt Sally would have been considerably
more shocked and would have said so.
What do you make of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing I can make out of it is that
she didn&#8217;t go out that first night. But if she
<i>didn&#8217;t</i> visit Curlew&#8217;s Nest that night, then who
in the world <i>did</i>?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>This certainly was a poser, and neither of
the two girls could find an adequate conjecture
that would answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, this Horatio Gaines who hired the
bungalow must be her grandfather. Of
course, the <i>name</i> is different, but he may be
the grandfather on her mother&#8217;s side. But if
that is the case, who is the &#8216;Hon. Arthur Ramsay&#8217;?&#8221;
questioned Phyllis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps her father or her other grandfather,&#8221;
ventured Leslie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s possible; but I wish I had found
out from Aunt Sally if she knew the name of
the grandfather who is ill. That might explain
something. I wish I had asked her at
the time. I believe I&#8217;ll go for the broilers
myself to-morrow and see if I can find out
any more in some way that won&#8217;t make her
suspect,&#8221; declared Phyllis.
</p>
<p>The next morning Phyllis was as good as
her word. She went down to the village alone,
as Leslie had matters that kept her at home
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
that day. But she came flying back breathless,
to impart her news.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I managed to lead the conversation around&mdash;to
that grandfather business&mdash;again,&#8221;
panted Phyllis, to Leslie, when she had induced
her chum to come down to the beach for
a moment, &#8220;and what do you think she said?
That his name was <i>&#8216;Ramsay&#8217;!</i> Now what do
you make of <i>that?</i> If his name is Ramsay,
he can&#8217;t be the man who hired that bungalow&mdash;and
we&#8217;re all on the wrong track!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it doesn&#8217;t prove that at all,&#8221; insisted
Leslie. &#8220;The one who rented the bungalow,
no matter what his name was, certainly had an
envelop in his possession addressed to <i>Ramsay</i>.
So you see there&#8217;s a connection somewhere!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Phyllis had to admit that this was so. &#8220;But
here&#8217;s something else stranger than that&mdash;what
do you think of my having been introduced
to and becoming acquainted with our
&#8216;exclusive young friend&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie certainly opened her eyes in astonishment.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
&#8220;You&#8217;re surely joking!&#8221; she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, positive truth! It happened this way:
I was just about to leave with my chickens under
my arm, when in walks this precious Miss
Ramsay, right into the room. I could see she
was prepared to turn on that cold stare effect
again, but I never so much as noticed her existence.
And then Aunt Sally bustled in,&mdash;she&#8217;d
been upstairs a minute,&mdash;and blest if
she didn&#8217;t introduce us after all! Said the
most complimentary things about yours truly,
and how I was staying at my bungalow on the
beach; and then she mentioned you, too, and
told about you being in the &#8216;Rest Haven&#8217; bungalow.
It struck me that our young lady sort
of pricked up her ears at that (though it <i>may</i>
have been only imagination). But she just
said &#8216;How-de-do,&#8217; rather carelessly&mdash;didn&#8217;t
offer to shake hands or anything.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I muttered something about it being a
pleasant day and hoping she was enjoying the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
place. But she only replied, &#8216;Oh, ya-as,
thanks!&#8217; with that awfully English accent, and
walked out of the room. Well, anyhow,
we&#8217;re formally acquainted now (whether either
one of us enjoy it or not!), and that may be a
useful thing later, perhaps.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was still dark the next morning when Leslie
awoke from a dreamless sleep&mdash;awoke suddenly,
with the distinct impression that something
unusual was happening. She lay perfectly
still for several moments, trying to localize
the sensation more definitely. In her
room were two windows&mdash;a small one facing
Curlew&#8217;s Nest and a large, broad one facing
the sea. Leslie always had this window wide
open, and her bed was so placed that she could
easily look out of it.
</p>
<p>She did so now, and noticed the first light
streak of dawn along the east, and a brilliant
star so close to the horizon that it seemed to be
resting on the edge of the tossing ocean. Then
her heart leaped and felt as if it almost turned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
over&mdash;for between her and the light, at the
window, she descried the shape of a dark head!
</p>
<p>Involuntarily Leslie sprang up to a sitting
position. Then the tension relaxed and she
drew a deep breath of relief. It was only
Rags, standing on his hind legs at the window,
his great shaggy head silhouetted against the
light. In another instant he had uttered his
low, rumbling growl of uneasiness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Rags? What do you see?&#8221; she
called softly to him. He forsook the window
for a moment and trotted over to nuzzle his
head on her pillow, but almost immediately
hurried back to his post at the window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something worrying him!&#8221; she
thought. &#8220;Now I wonder what it can be.
Suppose&mdash;suppose it were some one around
that other bungalow again! I&#8217;d better get up
and see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She rose softly, slipped on a warm dressing-gown
and slippers, and peered first out of the
side window at Curlew&#8217;s Nest. But the darkness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
was still intense on this side, there was no
tell-tale light in the chinks of the shutters, and
she was forced, after watching for several moments,
to conclude that nothing was amiss in
this region.
</p>
<p>Then she went to the window facing the
ocean, pushed Rags aside a trifle, and cuddled
down beside him on the window-seat. The
dawn was growing every moment brighter.
The streak of gray along the horizon had
grown to a broad belt of pink, and very faintly
the objects on the beach were beginning to be
visible. Rags still rumbled his uneasy growl
at intervals, and stared intently at something
Leslie&#8217;s eye could not yet discern.
</p>
<p>It was only by following the direction of his
gaze that she presently realized there was something
moving on the beach somewhere in front
of Curlew&#8217;s Nest. Then her heart actually
did seem to stop beating for an instant, for in
the growing light she at last could distinguish
a dark form moving stealthily about by the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
old log where Rags had dug up the &#8220;Dragon&#8217;s
Secret!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! who can it be? And what are they doing
there?&#8221; she whispered distractedly to Rags.
The dog&#8217;s only reply was to growl a little
louder, and she promptly silenced him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be a good dog, Rags! Don&#8217;t make a
sound! It will rouse Aunt Marcia, and besides
I <i>must</i> see who is there, if possible!&#8221;
Rags settled down again to a quieter watch
with evident reluctance.
</p>
<p>With every passing moment, day was approaching
nearer, and the scene out over the
ocean was one of surprising beauty, had Leslie
only been less occupied and had time
to observe it. The band of pink had melted
into gold, and a thousand rosy little clouds
dimpled the sky above. It was now so light
that the dark shape on the beach stood out with
comparative clearness. It had been bending
down and rising up at intervals, and it took
little guessing on Leslie&#8217;s part to conjecture
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
what was happening. Some one was digging
in the spot where the &#8220;Dragon&#8217;s Secret&#8221; had
been hidden!
</p>
<p>&#8220;What if it is Miss Ramsay?&#8221; thought Leslie.
&#8220;Oh, it <i>must</i> be she! Who else could it
be? She&#8217;s looking for that box, and she can&#8217;t
find it because we&#8217;ve taken it away. Oh,
what ought I to do about it? If only Phyllis
were here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this moment she realized from the actions
of the unknown person that the search was evidently
abandoned. The figure stood upright,
struck its hands together, and threw away some
implement like a board, with which the digging
had been done. Then, with a discouraged
shrug of the shoulders and a hasty glance
back at the two cottages, it turned and walked
away down the beach and was shortly out of
sight.
</p>
<p>And it was then that Leslie sank back on the
window seat with a little gasp of sheer astonishment.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>The figure was not&mdash;<i>could</i> not have been
that of Miss Ramsay! It was a <i>man</i>&mdash;a tall,
burly man; and as he walked away, his gait
gave evidence of a decided limp!

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR</h3>
</div>

<p>So anxious was Leslie to impart this newest
development to Phyllis that morning, that
she ate no breakfast at all, a departure which
worried Miss Marcia not a little. But Leslie
was out of the house and off the moment she
had finished washing the dishes.
</p>
<p>It was some time before she could locate her
companion, as the Kelvins had gone off early
on a fishing expedition a short way up the inlet,
having persuaded Phyllis to join them, a
thing she had done but little of late. After a
long walk and much halloo-ing, however, Leslie
sighted their boat. And it took considerable
time before she could persuade Phyllis to
come ashore, as she could not very well impart
to her, standing on the bank, that she had news
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
of vital importance concerning their secret.
</p>
<p>When Phyllis had at last been lured ashore
and the two had walked away out of sight, she
told the tale of her curious experience at dawn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, Phyllis, what do you make of
it?&#8221; she demanded, wide eyed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one thing to make of it,&#8221; returned
Phyllis, gravely, &#8220;And that is&mdash;there&#8217;s
some one else mixed up in this&mdash;some
one we haven&#8217;t known about or counted on at
all! I thought Miss Ramsay, all along, was
the only one concerned in it. Now we can only
guess that that isn&#8217;t so. But how to make
head or tail of the whole thing is beyond me.
What kind of a man did you say he was?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie described him again. &#8220;Of course,
it was still hardly light and I couldn&#8217;t see him
plainly at all,&#8221; she ended. &#8220;I never even got
a glimpse of his face, nor how he was dressed.
But he was tall and broad-shouldered, and I
think stooped a little and walked with quite a
decided limp.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That last fact ought to help to identify him,
if nothing else,&#8221; mused Phyllis. &#8220;But I confess
I&#8217;m more at sea than ever about the whole
thing. I was beginning to think I&#8217;d reduced
things to some kind of a theory, but this upsets
everything. And it annoys me so to think I&#8217;m
always out of it, being so far away from Curlew&#8217;s
Nest. I do believe I&#8217;ll have to come and
spend my nights with you or I&#8217;ll never be on
the scene of action at the most interesting
time!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I <i>do</i> wish you would!&#8221; urged Leslie,
earnestly. &#8220;I&#8217;m really beginning to be quite
nervous about all this. It&#8217;s so uncanny, not
being able to say a word about it to Aunt Marcia
or any one&mdash;being all alone there, or as
good as alone, when these queer things happen.
Don&#8217;t you suppose we could arrange it somehow
that you could come over and stay with
me&mdash;without having it seem odd or out of the
way to the others?&#8221;
</p>
<p>They both thought hard over the problem
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
for a moment. Suddenly Phyllis cried,&mdash;&#8220;I
have it&mdash;I think! I heard Father and Ted
planning to-day to be off fishing to-night, and
as many nights after as the conditions are
good. They just adore that kind of thing and
have done very little of it this time. As a rule,
I don&#8217;t mind a bit staying alone at the bungalow
if I don&#8217;t happen to go with them. But
I&#8217;ve never before had the excuse of having
you here to be with. It will seem perfectly
natural for me to say that, as they&#8217;re to be
away, I&#8217;ll spend the night with you. How&#8217;s
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, just the thing!&#8221; exclaimed Leslie, enthusiastically.
&#8220;And now let&#8217;s go back and
take a swim. It&#8217;s fairly mild and the best
time of day for it. You left your suit at
our house last time, so it&#8217;s very convenient.
You won&#8217;t have to walk all the way back to
your place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They strolled back to Rest Haven in a leisurely
fashion and had just turned the corner
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
of the house and come in sight of the front
veranda, when what they saw there almost took
them off their feet. On the veranda sat Aunt
Marcia, rocking comfortably back and forth,
and opposite her, in another rocker sat&mdash;could
their eyes have deceived them?&mdash;who but the
redoubtable <i>Miss Ramsay!</i>
</p>
<p>She was dressed as they had seen her in the
village store, and she was chatting, with an
appearance of the greatest affability, with Miss
Marcia. The two girls stared at her in ill-concealed
amazement&mdash;so ill-concealed, in fact,
that even Miss Marcia noticed it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Ramsay and I have been getting acquainted
while we waited for you to come
back,&#8221; she remarked, somewhat bewildered by
their speechless consternation. &#8220;She says she
made your acquaintance at Aunt Sally Blake&#8217;s
in the village, where she is boarding.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;er, yes!&#8221; stuttered Phyllis, remembering
her manners. &#8220;It&#8217;s very pleasant to see
you here, Miss&mdash;Ramsay. I see you are acquainted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
with Miss Crane. This is Miss Leslie
Crane her niece.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie bowed and murmured something inarticulate,
but Miss Ramsay was affable to a
degree. &#8220;I drove over to your cottage first,
Miss Kelvin,&#8221; she chatted on, after her introduction,
&#8220;with some eggs Aunt Sally promised
you. She was going to send them by the
butcher boy, but he did not stop this morning,
so, as I was going out, I offered to take
them. But I found no one at your place, so
I came on here, introduced myself to Miss
Crane, and we&#8217;ve been having a nice time together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The astonishment of the girls at this
amazing change of front in the difficult Miss
Ramsay was beyond all expression. Her intonation
was slightly English, her manner
charming. They had not dreamed that she
could be so attractive. And so fresh and
pretty was she that she was a real delight to
look upon.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What delightful little cottages these are!&#8221;
she went on. &#8220;They look so attractive from
the outside. I&#8217;m sure they must be equally so
from the inside. We have nothing quite on
this style in England, where I came from.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you like to go through ours?&#8221;
asked Miss Marcia, hospitably. &#8220;Leslie, take
Miss Ramsay through. Perhaps she will be
interested to see the interior.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll be delighted!&#8221; exclaimed Miss
Ramsay, and rose to accompany Leslie.
</p>
<p>It did not take them long to make the round
of Rest Haven. Rather to her hostess&#8217;s astonishment,
the girl seemed more enthusiastic
over Leslie&#8217;s room than any of the others and
lingered there the longest, though it was by no
means the most attractive.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a wonderful view you have of the
sea!&#8221; she said. And then she strolled to the
other window and looked out, long and curiously.
&#8220;That&#8217;s an interesting little cottage
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
next door,&#8221; she remarked presently. &#8220;Is it&mdash;is
it just like this one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why no. It&#8217;s larger and differently arranged
and furnished more elaborately, too, I&mdash;I
believe,&#8221; faltered Leslie, hoping she had
not appeared to know too much about it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if we could go through it?&#8221; went
on the visitor. &#8220;I&mdash;I just love to see what
these little seashore places look like. They&#8217;re
so different from ours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I hardly think so!&#8221; cried Leslie. &#8220;You
see it&#8217;s all locked up for the winter, and Mrs.
Danforth, who owns it, has the key.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl looked at her intently. &#8220;And
there&#8217;s no other way, I suppose, beside the
front door?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How should I know?&#8221; countered Leslie,
suddenly on her guard. &#8220;If there <i>were</i> would
it be right to try it, do you think? Wouldn&#8217;t
it be too much like trespassing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course!&#8221; laughed Miss Ramsay. &#8220;I
only meant that it would be fun to look it over,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
if there were any proper way of doing so.
You see, Grandfather and I might be here another
summer and I&#8217;d just love to rent a little
cottage like either one of these two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She turned away from the window and they
sauntered out of the room and back to the veranda.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now that you&#8217;ve seen Leslie&#8217;s bungalow,
you must run over and see ours, especially
as it was at ours you at first intended to call!&#8221;
said Phyllis. &#8220;Come along, Leslie, and we&#8217;ll
show Miss Ramsay over Fisherman&#8217;s Luck!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It struck the girls that Miss Ramsay showed
a trifle less enthusiasm about returning to the
other cottage. Still, she agreed, with a fair
assumption of polite interest, and they tramped
back along the beach, chatting agreeably.
</p>
<p>But she showed very genuine pleasure in the
entirely different appearance of Phyllis&#8217;s
abode, and a large surprise at the presence of a
grand piano in so unusual a place. And when
Leslie had informed her of Phyllis&#8217;s talent she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
eagerly demanded that they be given an immediate
concert.
</p>
<p>And it was Phyllis&#8217;s sudden whim to render
a very charming and touching program, ending
with the Chopin &#8220;Berceuse.&#8221; The music
died away in a hushed chord, and Leslie, who
had been gazing out at the ocean during its
rendering, was astonished when she looked
around to see the visitor furtively wiping away
a few tears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a perfect goose about some kinds of
music!&#8221; she muttered apologetically, and then,
abruptly, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you two girls please call me
Eileen? I&#8217;m so lonely here and I haven&#8217;t
any friends and&mdash;and&mdash;I&#8217;d like to see you
often.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then the impulsive Phyllis put a comradely
arm about her shoulder. &#8220;Just come as
often as you like. We&#8217;ll always be delighted
to see you. I&#8217;m sure we three can have a
jolly time together. And be sure to call us
by our first names, too.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Phyllis and Leslie,&#8221; she said
simply. &#8220;You are more than kind to me.
But I must be getting back now. It&#8217;s most
time for me to go to the hospital to see Grandfather.
He&#8217;s <i>so</i> ill, and I&#8217;m so worried about
him!&#8221; Again the tears came into her eyes.
&#8220;But good-by! I&#8217;m coming over to-morrow
with the car to take you all out for a spin!&#8221;
And she was gone, running down the path to
where she had parked the car.
</p>
<p>When they were alone, the two girls looked
at one another.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the most amazing thing I ever heard
of&mdash;this change in her!&#8221; marveled Phyllis.
&#8220;Have you the slightest idea what has caused
it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I have,&#8221; answered Leslie, and she
told of the girl&#8217;s curious conduct when she was
being shown through Rest Haven. &#8220;I believe
she had a purpose in coming here&mdash;she may
have thought she could find out something from
us. And she certainly thought she might get
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
into Curlew&#8217;s Nest, though I don&#8217;t believe for
a minute the reason she gave was the only one.
I think she didn&#8217;t particularly want to go to
see your place, either, but when she got here
she liked it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I like her&mdash;strange as you may
think it!&#8221; declared Phyllis. &#8220;I&#8217;ve quite
changed my mind about her. Do you know,
I think that girl is having a whole lot of trouble,
somehow or other&mdash;trouble she can&#8217;t tell
us about. What the mystery is and how it is
connected with that cottage, I don&#8217;t see. But
I do believe that she likes <i>us</i>, and if we&#8217;re ever
going to solve this mystery at all, it will probably
be through her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we&mdash;do you think we ought to&mdash;give
her the Dragon&#8217;s Secret?&#8221; faltered Leslie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly do <i>not</i>&mdash;at least not yet! I&#8217;ll
wait till I know a few things more before I
make a move like that!&#8221; declared the emphatic
Phyllis. &#8220;And now come along and let&#8217;s have
our swim.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE CURIOUS BEHAVIOR OF TED</h3>
</div>

<p>True to their previous arrangement,
Phyllis spent the night with Leslie at
Rest Haven. They read together till a very
late hour and then sat up even later, in the
dark, watching from Leslie&#8217;s window to see if
there were any further developments at Curlew&#8217;s
Nest. But nothing unusual happened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that exactly my luck!&#8221; complained
Phyllis. &#8220;If I weren&#8217;t here, I suppose there&#8217;d
be a half a dozen spooky visitors!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; laughed Leslie. &#8220;Probably nothing
will happen again for some time. Remember
how very few times it <i>has</i> happened, anyway.
But it is provoking&mdash;just when we&#8217;re
all ready for it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; exclaimed Phyllis suddenly,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
&#8220;this is the time when I&#8217;d just love to
go through that place again! What do you
say if we get out of this window and try it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no!&#8221; cried Leslie. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t
think of such a thing! Can&#8217;t you see how
awfully dangerous it would be? Just suppose
some one should take it into their heads to
visit the place again to-night&mdash;and find us in
there. It would be a terrible position for us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be afraid of Eileen!&#8221; stoutly
declared Phyllis. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather enjoy meeting
her there. It would give her something to explain!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s some one else you might meet
there who might not be so amusing&mdash;the man
with the limp!&#8221; Leslie reminded her.
</p>
<p>Phyllis had to acknowledge that this was so,
and the subject was dropped, much to Leslie&#8217;s
relief.
</p>
<p>Next afternoon, Eileen came over with her
car and invited the girls and Miss Marcia to
go for a long ride. They all accepted with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
alacrity, enjoying the prospect of a change.
Eileen insisted that Miss Marcia sit by her
while she drove. And as she did this with remarkable
ease, she was able to converse pleasantly
with her guests most of the time. She
took them for a very long drive, and they were
all astonished at her familiarity with the roads
in that part of the country. She assured them
that she had grown to know them well, during
the long days lately when she had little else
to do than to explore them with the car.
</p>
<p>It was dusk when they returned at last to
the beach, and, having deposited Phyllis first
at her bungalow, Eileen drove the others to
theirs. They bade her good night at the foot
of the wooden path that led up the slope to
their cottage, and she sat and watched them,
without starting the car, till they had disappeared
indoors. But it so happened that Leslie
turned around, opened the door, and came
out again almost at once to get an armful of
wood for the fire from the bin on the back
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
veranda. And in so doing, it happened also
that she witnessed a curious little incident.
</p>
<p>Eileen seemed to have had a slight difficulty
in starting the car, but it was in motion now,
going slowly, and had advanced only about as
far as the path leading up to Curlew&#8217;s Nest.
Leslie stood in the darkness of her porch, idly
watching its progress, when something that
happened caused her heart to leap into her
throat. Out from some thick bushes at the
edge of the road, there appeared a dark form,
which signaled to the car. Eileen whirled the
wheel around, applied the brake, and the car
almost came to a stop. Almost&mdash;but not quite,
for the figure leaped into it while it was still
going. Then Eileen stepped on the accelerator,
the car shot forward, and was almost instantly
out of sight.

<br />
</span>
</div>

<p>Leslie got her wood and went indoors in a
daze. What could it all mean? What duplicity
had Eileen been guilty of now? The thing
certainly looked very, very sinister, consider it
how you would! And she could breathe no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
word of it to her aunt, who, as Leslie entered,
straightway began on a long eulogy of Eileen,
her delightful manners, her thoughtfulness,
and her kindness in giving them an afternoon
of such enjoyment. It seemed to Leslie, considering
what had just happened, that she must
certainly scream with nervousness if Miss Marcia
did not stop, and she tried vainly several
times to steer her to another theme. But Miss
Marcia had found a topic that interested her,
and she was not to be diverted from it till it
was exhausted!
</p>
<p>With all her strength, Leslie longed for the
time to come when Phyllis should appear, for
she had promised to come again for the night.
And when the supper was eaten and the dishes
had been disposed of, Leslie went outside and
paced and paced back and forth on the front
veranda, peering vainly into the darkness to
watch for her friend. Miss Marcia, indoors
with Rags by the blazing fire, called several
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
times to her to come in and share the warmth
and comfort, but she felt she could not endure
the confinement in the house and the peaceful
sitting by the hearth, when her thoughts were
so upset. Would Phyllis never appear?
What could be keeping her?
</p>
<p>It was a small, but very active, indignation
meeting that was held when the two girls were
at last together. Leslie would not permit
Phyllis to go indoors for a time after she arrived,
though the night was rather chilly, but
kept her on the veranda to explain what had
happened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The deceitful little thing!&#8221; cried Phyllis.
&#8220;Now I see exactly what she took us all out
for this afternoon, even Miss Marcia&mdash;to get
rid of us all for a good long time while some
accomplice of hers did what they pleased in
Curlew&#8217;s Nest, quite undisturbed by any one
around!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what it must have been,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
agreed Leslie. &#8220;But who could that other person
have been?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The man with the limp?&#8221; suggested
Phyllis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m very sure it was not he. This
person sprang into the car while it was still in
motion&mdash;was very active, evidently. I&#8217;m certain
the man with the limp could never have
done that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, was it a man or a woman? Surely
you could tell <i>that</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, actually I couldn&#8217;t. It was getting so
dark, and the figure was so far off, and it all
happened so quickly that I couldn&#8217;t see. But,
Phyllis, I&#8217;m horribly disappointed in Eileen!
I had begun to think she was lovely, and that
we had misjudged her badly. And now&mdash;<i>this</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s simply <i>using</i> us&mdash;that&#8217;s plain,&#8221;
agreed Phyllis. &#8220;She evidently intended to do
so from the first, after she found out we were
right on the spot here. She deliberately came
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
out to cultivate our acquaintance and make it
seem natural for her to be around here. Then
she and the one she&#8217;s working with planned to
get us away from here for the whole afternoon
and have the field free for anything they
pleased. Faugh! It makes me sick to think
of being duped like that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But after yesterday&mdash;and the way she
acted when you played Chopin, and what she
said about our friendship, and all that&mdash;Was
<i>anything</i> genuine at all?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a thing!&#8221; declared Phyllis, positively.
&#8220;All put on to get a little farther into our good
graces. Well, I&#8217;ll never be caught like <i>that</i>
again. We&#8217;ll continue to seem very friendly
to Miss Eileen Ramsay, but we won&#8217;t be caught
twice!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, what made you so late to-night?&#8221;
questioned Leslie, suddenly changing
the subject. &#8220;I thought you&#8217;d never come!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I meant to tell you right away, but all
this put it out of my head. When I got home
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
after the ride, I found only Father there. He
said Ted had been away most of the afternoon.
He&#8217;d gone down to the village after some new
fishing-tackle and hadn&#8217;t come back yet. I
started in and got supper, and still he didn&#8217;t
appear. Then we began to get worried and
&#8217;phoned down to Smithson&#8217;s in the village
where they sell tackle, to see if he could be
there. They said he <i>had</i> been, early in the
afternoon, but they hadn&#8217;t seen him since.
We called up every other place he could possibly
be, but nowhere was he to be found. I
was beginning to be quite upset about him&mdash;when
in he walked!
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was very quiet and uncommunicative
and wouldn&#8217;t explain why he was so late.
And then, presently, he said in a very casual
manner that his hand was hurt. And when he
showed it to us, I almost screamed, for it was
very badly hurt&mdash;all torn and lacerated. He
had it wrapped in his handkerchief, but we
made him undo it, and I bathed it and Father
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
put iodine on, and I fixed him a sling to wear
it in. The thing about it was that he didn&#8217;t
seem to want to tell us how it happened. Said
he met a friend who invited him to ride in
their car and had taken him for a long drive.
And on the way home they&#8217;d had a little breakdown,
and Ted had tried to help fix it and had
got his hand caught in the machinery somehow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he was plainly very anxious not to be
questioned about it. And Father says that
Ted is old enough now to be trusted, and
should not be compelled to speak when he
doesn&#8217;t wish to, and so nothing more was said.
But it all seemed a little strange to me, for,
honestly, I don&#8217;t know a single soul in this
village that Ted knows who owns a car, or any
other of our friends who would be likely to
be around these parts just now. They&#8217;re all
home at their schools or colleges. When I
asked him whose car he was in, he just glared
at me and said I always did ask too many impertinent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
questions! But I can&#8217;t make much
out of it, and I hate any more puzzles to think
about.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie, however, could cast no light on this
new problem; and she was somewhat more interested,
moreover, in their other puzzle. But
as she was about to revert to that subject again,
Phyllis suddenly interrupted:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, by the way, soon after I got home,
Aunt Sally &#8217;phoned to ask if we were back
from the ride yet. And when I said we&#8217;d
been back some time, she said she was quite
worried because Eileen had not yet appeared
and it was late and dark. I said perhaps she
had stopped somewhere in the village, as she
had left us a good while before. Quite a little
later, just before Ted got in, Aunt Sally
&#8217;phoned again to say that Eileen had just arrived.
She&#8217;d had some trouble with the car
after she left us and had to stop and fix it. I
wonder what was the matter <i>there</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Suddenly Leslie clutched her friend&#8217;s arm.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
&#8220;Phyllis Kelvin, are we going crazy, or is
there some strange connection in all this?
Can&#8217;t you see?&mdash;Ted late and mixed up with
some breakdown&mdash;Eileen late and had trouble
with the machinery,&mdash;and with my own eyes
I saw some one jump into her car!&mdash;Could it,
<i>could</i> it be possible that person was&mdash;<i>Ted</i>?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Phyllis stared at her as if she thought Leslie
certainly <i>had</i> &#8220;gone crazy.&#8221; &#8220;There&#8217;s not the
slightest chance in the world!&#8221; she declared
positively. &#8220;Why, only last night, when I was
explaining to Ted about Eileen and how we&#8217;d
become friends, all he said was: &#8216;Well, so
you&#8217;ve taken up with some other dame, have
you! Might as well not have brought you
down here, all the good you are to <i>us</i>, this time.
Haven&#8217;t been fishing with us more than twice
since we came! Whoever this Eileen is, don&#8217;t
for goodness sake have her around here!&#8217; If
he&#8217;d known her, he certainly would have shown
it in some way. He acted utterly disgusted
with me for having made her acquaintance!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That may all be true, but it doesn&#8217;t prove
that <i>he</i> is not acquainted with her,&#8221; stubbornly
affirmed Leslie.
</p>
<p>And Phyllis was driven to acknowledge the
force of the argument!
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>A TRAP IS SET</h3>
</div>

<p>They went indoors at last and tried to settle
down to reading, but it was very difficult
to distract their minds from disturbing
thoughts. Miss Marcia retired early, as the
ride had tired her, and they were left to their
own devices. At length they gave up the attempt
to read and sat talking in whispers over
the dying fire. When there was nothing left
but ashes, Leslie suggested, with a shiver, that
they go to bed, and they withdrew to Leslie&#8217;s
room.
</p>
<p>Needless to say they did <i>not</i> go to bed at
once, but sat long by the side window, staring
across at Curlew&#8217;s Nest. And it was then that
Phyllis suddenly had her great idea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, see here, Leslie Crane, I have an idea
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
and I&#8217;m going to do something, and I don&#8217;t
want you to interfere with me. Do you understand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; whispered Leslie,
looking alarmed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean just this. You&#8217;re going to stay
right where you are, with Rags, and keep
watch. And I&#8217;m going to get out of the window
and go over and explore Curlew&#8217;s Nest by
myself!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Phyllis, are you crazy?&#8221; implored Leslie.
&#8220;I think that is one of the most dangerous
things you could do!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of the sort. It&#8217;s safer to-night
than it would be almost any other time. Because&mdash;can&#8217;t
you see?&mdash;some one has evidently
been here all the afternoon, when the coast was
entirely clear, and no doubt they&#8217;ve done all
they wish to do there for <i>this</i> day, anyhow!
There couldn&#8217;t <i>be</i> a better time than this very
night, for there&#8217;s not one chance in a hundred
that they&#8217;ll be back again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But just suppose the hundredth chance did
happen, what would you do?&#8221; argued Leslie in
despair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do?&mdash;I&#8217;d shout like everything to you to
turn Rags loose and call up the village constable
and Father. Or better yet, I&#8217;d blow
this police whistle which Father always insists
on my carrying so that I can call them in to
meals when they&#8217;re down on the beach. If
you hear <i>that</i>&mdash;just start things going.
That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m leaving you and Rags here
on guard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t like it&mdash;I don&#8217;t like it at all!&#8221;
moaned Leslie. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if
you only met Eileen there&mdash;but you can&#8217;t tell
whom you might encounter. I believe there&#8217;s
something more dangerous and desperate about
this affair than either of us have guessed. I
don&#8217;t know why I think so&mdash;it&#8217;s just come to
me lately. It&#8217;s a sort of&mdash;presentiment I
can&#8217;t seem to shake off!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; declared Phyllis, not to be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
balked. &#8220;If I met any one there, it could only
be Eileen, and she&#8217;s the one I&#8217;m crazy to encounter.
After the way she has treated us,
I&#8217;d have a few things to say to that young
person for trespassing on Mrs. Danforth&#8217;s
property. Mrs. Danforth has always asked
that we keep an eye on these cottages of hers
while we&#8217;re here,&mdash;it&#8217;s an understood thing
between us&mdash;so I&#8217;d be entirely within my
rights in going in there to look the place over,
especially if I suspected anything queer, and
the other person would be quite in the wrong.
Don&#8217;t you see?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I see that, but it doesn&#8217;t lessen
the fact that it may be dangerous!&#8221; sighed Leslie,
wearily.
</p>
<p>Phyllis ignored this. &#8220;If the hundredth
chance should happen and I encounter Eileen,
or if I come across anything very unusual and
think you ought to see it, I&#8217;ll let you know.
Only in case of the hundred and <i>first</i> chance of
real danger will I blow this whistle. Hold on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
tight to Rags and don&#8217;t let him try to follow
me. By-by! See you later!&#8221; And before
Leslie could expostulate further, she had
slipped out of the window, her electric torch
in her hand, and was out of sight around the
corner of the neighboring cottage.
</p>
<p>Leslie remained half hanging out of the window,
in an agony of suspense. The night was
moonless and very dark. Added to that, a
heavy sea-mist hung over everything like a
blanket, and, out of the gloom, the steady
pounding of the surf came to her with ominous
insistence. The chill of the foggy air was
penetrating, and she wrapped a sweater about
her almost without realizing that she had done
so. Rags was on the seat beside her, ears
alertly cocked.
</p>
<p>There was not a sound from the next house,
nor could she even see a single gleam of light
from the chinks in the shutters. Where could
Phyllis be? Surely there had been time enough
for her to have entered the place, looked about,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
and come out again. What could she be
doing?
</p>
<p>Then her brain began to be filled with horrible
pictures of all the possible and impossible
things that might have happened. So
beyond all bearing did this feature become at
length that she came to the sudden conclusion
she would endure it no longer. She would get
out of the window, herself, and go in search
of her friend. If the worst came to worst,
Rags could do some one a pretty bit of damage!
</p>
<p>She had actually got as far as to put one foot
over the low sill, when she quickly pulled it
back again. A dark form had slipped around
the corner of the other house and was hurrying
toward her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Leslie! Leslie! Quick!&mdash;can you come
here with me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie almost collapsed, so swift was the reaction
of relief at hearing Phyllis&#8217;s voice, after
all her terrible imaginings.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is it? What have you found?&#8221; she
managed to reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t explain to you here,&#8221; whispered
Phyllis. &#8220;It would take too long. Come
along with me and see for yourself. It&#8217;s perfectly
safe. There&#8217;s not a soul around. I&#8217;ve
been in the house. Bring Rags along&mdash;it
won&#8217;t hurt. There have been queer doings
here to-day&mdash;evidently. You can see it all in
five minutes. Do come!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In spite of all her previous fears, the temptation
was too much for Leslie. If Phyllis had
examined the ground and found it safe, surely
there was no need for fear, and her curiosity
to see what her friend had seen was now
stronger than she could resist. She crept
softly out of the window, speaking to Rags in
a whisper, and the dog leaped lightly out after
her.
</p>
<p>They stole around the corner of the next
house, three black shadows in the enveloping
mist, and not till Phyllis had closed the side
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
door of Curlew&#8217;s Nest behind them was a word
spoken.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Follow me into the living-room,&#8221; she ordered,
&#8220;and if you don&#8217;t see something there
that surprises you, I miss my guess!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She switched on the electric torch, and Leslie
and Rags followed after her in solemn procession.
From what she had said, Leslie expected
to see the place in a terrible disorder,
at the very least, and was considerably surprised,
when she came into the room, to observe
nothing out of its place. In some bewilderment
she looked about, while Phyllis
stood by, watching her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; she whispered.
&#8220;Everything seems to be just as it was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look on the center-table!&#8221; commanded
Phyllis, and she turned the torch full on that
article of furniture.
</p>
<p>Leslie tiptoed over to examine it. Then
she uttered a little half-suppressed cry. On
the table was a slip of paper&mdash;not a very large
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
slip, and evidently torn from some larger sheet.
And on this paper were a few words, type-written.
She bent to read them. It ran:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>It is advisable that the article stolen from its hiding-place
be returned to it as speedily as possible, as
otherwise, consequences most serious to all parties
concerned will result.
</p>
</div>
<p>Leslie turned deadly pale as she read it and
seized Phyllis spasmodically by the arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come out of here this moment!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;I will not stay in this house another
instant. I told you it was dangerous!&#8221;
and she dragged her friend, with the strength
of terror to the side door.
</p>
<p>Outside, as the chill mist struck her, she
breathed a great sigh of relief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a little &#8217;fraid-cat you are!&#8221; laughed
Phyllis. &#8220;What in the world were you frightened
about?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie shivered. &#8220;Oh, the whole thing
strikes me as too uncanny for words! Some
one has been in here and left that warning.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
They may be around here now, for all you
know. Who do you suppose it can be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a very good notion who it was, but
it&#8217;s too chilly to explain it standing here. Go
over to the house with Rags and I&#8217;ll be there
directly. I want to go back a moment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Phyllis, Phyllis, <i>don&#8217;t</i> go back there
again!&#8221; implored Leslie, almost beside herself
with an alarm she could hardly explain.
&#8220;What do you want to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind! Go back! I&#8217;ll be there in
two minutes.&#8221; And tearing herself from Leslie&#8217;s
grasp, Phyllis ran back into the dark
bungalow.
</p>
<p>But Leslie would not return to her own
house and desert her companion, though she
could not bring herself to enter again that
fear-inspiring place. So she lingered about
outside in a state of unenviable desperation till
Phyllis once more emerged from the dark doorway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you couldn&#8217;t leave me, after all!&#8221; Phyllis
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
laughed. &#8220;Well, come back to bed now,
and I&#8217;ll tell you all about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were chilled through with the drenching
mist by the time they returned, and not
till they were enveloped in the warm bed-clothing
did Phyllis deign to explain her ideas
about the newest development in their mystery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were mightily scared by that little
piece of paper, and I confess that I was
startled myself, for a minute. But after I&#8217;d
thought it over, it suddenly dawned on me that
there was precious little to be scared about,
and I&#8217;ll tell you why. I&#8217;m perfectly convinced
that that thing was written and placed
there by my brother <i>Ted</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie sat up in bed with a jerk. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t possibly mean it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly do, and here&#8217;s my reason: You
yourself convinced me, earlier this evening,
that there was a chance of Ted&#8217;s being mixed
up in this thing somehow. I can&#8217;t imagine
how he got into it&mdash;that&#8217;s a mystery past my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
explaining. But it looks very much as if he
knew this Eileen, and that he was poking
around here this afternoon while we were away.
Now he suspects that <i>we</i> are mixed up in it,
too, for he saw us come out of the bungalow
that day. Well, if Eileen has told him about
the Dragon&#8217;s Secret and its disappearance,
perhaps he thinks we know what happened to
it. At any rate, he&#8217;s taken the chance, and
written this warning for our inspection the
next time we happened in. He thinks it will
scare us, I suppose! He&#8217;ll presently find out
that we don&#8217;t scare for a cent! And I have
thought of a scheme as good as his!&mdash;Do you
know what I did when I went back there? I
took a pencil and <i>printed</i> on the bottom of that
paper just this:
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>The article will be returned to its hiding-place</i>.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do next.
In my trunk I have a little jewel-case, very
much the size and shape and weight of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
Dragon&#8217;s Secret. It&#8217;s one of those antimony
things you&#8217;ve often seen, covered with a kind
of carving that might easily pass for what&#8217;s
on that other one, if it weren&#8217;t <i>seen</i>. I&#8217;m
going to-morrow to make a burlap bag, just
like the one we found, and sew the jewel-case
in it, and it will be a sharp person who can tell
the difference between them till the bag is
opened. Then we&#8217;ll bury it in the place where
Rags dug up the other, some time to-morrow
when the coast is clear. After that we&#8217;ll wait
and see what happens next! Now what do
you think of my scheme?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds splendid to me,&#8221; admitted Leslie,
then she added uneasily: &#8220;But there&#8217;s
something you haven&#8217;t explained yet. You
think Ted wrote that thing, yet it is <i>type-written</i>!
How do you explain <i>that</i>?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s simple enough! We have an
old typewriter down here that Father uses
occasionally, and Ted frequently practises on
it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But did you notice the paper?&#8221; Leslie insisted.
&#8220;It was queer, thin, almost foreign-looking
stuff. Do you folks use that kind, or
happen to have it about?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. I suppose he got it
somewhere. What does it matter, anyway?&#8221;
answered Phyllis, sleepily. And in two minutes
more she was in the land of dreams.
</p>
<p>But Leslie, still unconvinced, tossed the
night through without closing her eyes.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE MAN WITH THE LIMP</h3>
</div>

<p>Two days had passed. To Leslie it was
a constant marvel, considering the secret
tension under which she lived, that outwardly
her life went on in the same peaceful groove.
She rose and dressed as usual, prepared the
meals, ate and chatted with Aunt Marcia,
walked on the beach or down to the village,
fished occasionally with Phyllis and the Kelvins,
took a dip in the ocean when it was not
too chilly, read and slept and idled, as if there
were nothing in the world but what was quiet
and normal and in the ordinary course of
things.
</p>
<p>Aunt Marcia suspected nothing. Even
Ted, who, she was certain, suspected many
things, laughed and chatted with and teased
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
her, and never by so much as a word or look
indicated the slightest suspicion of her interest
in Curlew&#8217;s Nest and its affairs. With Phyllis
his manner was somewhat different, and during
the last two days their relations had seemed
occasionally rather strained, but there was no
open break, in public at least.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But at home it&#8217;s another matter!&#8221; Phyllis
assured her. &#8220;Something&#8217;s come over him&mdash;I
can&#8217;t guess what. He will hardly speak
either to Father or myself. He doesn&#8217;t even
want to play his violin when we get together,
and usually he adores that. He&#8217;s moody and
silent and just&mdash;<i>grouchy</i>, most of the time!
And that&#8217;s unusual for Ted. I&#8217;ll give him
credit for being a pretty amiable fellow, as a
rule. I can&#8217;t make him out!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it surely is queer that we&#8217;ve seen
nothing more of Eileen, don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;
questioned Leslie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no. Considering that she gained
her point and got us away all that afternoon,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
I don&#8217;t think it at all queer. She&#8217;s done with
us now. Why should she try to keep on with
it? By the way, I called her up at Aunt
Sally&#8217;s last night. She wasn&#8217;t there, but
Aunt Sally said her grandfather has been
rather worse for the last two days and she&#8217;s
been at the hospital most of the time&mdash;was
there then. All of which may or may not be
so. As a matter of fact, I guess Aunt Sally
knows precious little of her doings when she&#8217;s
away in that car.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somehow, Leslie could never believe Eileen
quite as full of duplicity as Phyllis thought
her. While she had to admit that circumstances
made the girl&#8217;s conduct seem almost
inexcusable, there always lingered in her mind
a stubborn feeling that perhaps there was more
back of it all than they know&mdash;that Eileen herself
might be struggling with entangling problems.
And secretly she still felt a liking for
the girl. But she knew it was useless to express
these doubts to Phyllis, so she wisely kept
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
her own counsel. But there was one thing she
did allude to.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it strange that Eileen never told us
a word about her grandfather, or how sick he
was, or what was the matter with him? You
would have thought it natural, that day when
she took us riding, to say <i>something</i> about it,
anyway. I hardly see now how she could have
avoided it. And yet she did. You&#8217;d never
have thought she had such a thing as a sick
grandfather on her mind!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Leslie, you certainly are a trusting soul!&#8221;
exclaimed Phyllis, scornfully. &#8220;How do you
know she <i>has</i> a sick grandfather in any hospital?
I strongly doubt it myself!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I <i>can&#8217;t</i> believe she&#8217;s not telling the
truth about <i>that</i>!&#8221; cried Leslie, thoroughly
shocked. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe anything about
her any more?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I believe or don&#8217;t believe&mdash;about
<i>her</i>!&#8221; retorted Phyllis. &#8220;And
what&#8217;s more, there&#8217;s only one thing concerning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
her that I <i>am</i> interested in just now&mdash;whether
she has discovered the answer to that
note left in there and when she&mdash;or any one
else&mdash;is going to make the attempt to unearth
their treasure again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Phyllis had been as good as her word. On
the morning after that night of the fog, she
had returned to her bungalow before breakfast,
and had reappeared later at Rest Haven
with a mysterious bundle. When they had
both retired to Leslie&#8217;s room she revealed its
contents, a piece of burlap, an exact duplicate
of the one which contained the Dragon&#8217;s
Secret, and an antimony jewel-case. Then
they got down the original from its dusty shelf,
fashioned a bag, the exact size and shape of the
one Rags had unearthed, placed the jewel-case
in it, and sewed it up. When all was complete
it would have been extremely difficult to tell
the original from its duplicate, so nearly alike
did they seem.
</p>
<p>Late that afternoon, while Ted and his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
father were far up the inlet, and with the
beach entirely deserted, they buried the false
treasure-box in the sand by the old log.
Phyllis did the deed, while Leslie scouted the
beach in every direction, investigated every
nook and corner that could possibly conceal
any one, and made absolutely certain that they
were not observed. And from that time on
they had awaited results.
</p>
<p>And to their certain knowledge, there had
been none. Each day, at some hour when
there was least likelihood of any one being
near, they had examined the place, only to
find the buried bag still in its hiding-place,
untouched. At night they had taken turns
keeping watch, all the night through; but no
stealthy visitor had come to Curlew&#8217;s Nest, nor
had there been any during the day&mdash;of that
they were absolutely certain. The beach had
never seemed so free of visitors before.
</p>
<p>And thus matters stood on the second afternoon,
and they were beginning to be impatient
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
at inaction and delay. Then Phyllis had an
idea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what&#8217;s the matter!&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;We&#8217;re keeping too close a watch. We don&#8217;t
give anybody a chance to come within gunshot
of that place, unobserved, so how can we
expect that anything is going to happen? If
it&#8217;s Ted, don&#8217;t you suppose he sees us hanging
about here all the time? He&#8217;d be a goose to
try anything right in front of our eyes. No
doubt he&#8217;s seen one or the other of us at the
window all night, too. And if it&#8217;s Eileen or
any one else, it&#8217;s the same thing. Let&#8217;s go
off somewhere and give them a chance. Not
too far though, for we want to be where we
can get back with reasonable speed ourselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So they went for a stroll along the beach,
accompanied by Rags, who was only too delighted
at the prospect of an expedition that
promised some change. It was a mild, hazy
October afternoon. An opalescent mist lay
along the horizon and the waves rolled in lazily,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
too lazily to break with their accustomed crash.
Every little while there would be a flight of
wild geese, in V-shaped flying line, far overhead,
and their honking would float down
faintly as they pushed on in their southward
course. It was a golden afternoon, and Leslie
almost resented the fact that they had any
worries or problems on their minds.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, who in the world is that?&#8221; exclaimed
Phyllis, suddenly, as they rounded a slight
curve in the beach and came in sight of a
figure standing at the water&#8217;s edge, a rod and
long line in his hand, and a camp-stool and
fishing-kit beside him. &#8220;There hasn&#8217;t been a
stranger fishing in this region in an age!
People generally go down by the big bungalow
colony three miles farther along for that.
We almost never see any one here. I wonder
what it means!&#8221;
</p>
<p>As they came nearer, they could see more
plainly what sort of person he appeared to be.
He was tall and stalwart and gray-haired. A
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
slouch hat was pulled down to shade his eyes,
but still they could see that his face was alert
and kindly and placid, with twinkling gray
eyes and a whimsical mouth. He was obviously
an adept fisherman, as Phyllis remarked,
when they had witnessed the clever way in
which he managed a catch. They were very
near him by that time, and watching breathlessly.
Once his prey almost eluded him, but
with a skilful manipulation of his tackle, he
presently brought the big fellow, lashing
wildly, to land, well out of reach of the water.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; he exclaimed, winding up
his line, &#8220;but that fellow gave me a warm ten
minutes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls had by this time reached the spot
and were admiring the catch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Congratulations!&#8221; laughed Phyllis, with
the informal interest of the born fisherman.
&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t have done it myself, not after he
had almost escaped. He must weigh five
pounds!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>The stranger looked at them with interest.
&#8220;So you fish? Well, it&#8217;s the best sport in the
world. This bouncer has been dodging me all
the afternoon, and I vowed I&#8217;d get him before
I left. Almost had him once before, but he
got away with the bait. Wouldn&#8217;t let me
alone, though, even after that. I warned him
he was flirting with his fate!&#8221; And he laughed
a big, booming, pleasant laugh.
</p>
<p>At this moment Rags, who had been elsewhere
occupied, came bounding up, and
straightway made a bee-line over to investigate
the fish.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi! Stop that!&#8221; exclaimed the stranger.
&#8220;I intend to have that fish for my supper to-night!&#8221;
and he made a dash for his cherished
trophy. But Rags, disconcerted by the sudden
movement, was on his guard at once. As
the man approached, he sank his teeth into the
fish with a growl that was a warning not to
be ignored.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, call him off!&#8221; cried the man, anxiously,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
and Leslie, very much upset, sprang forward
to rescue the stranger&#8217;s dinner. But Rags
saw a chance for a lark; and as times had been
rather slow and uninteresting for him of late,
he determined to make the most of it. Seizing
the fish in a firm grip, he galloped madly
up the beach, the two girls wildly pursuing.
</p>
<p>There ensued a chase very similar to the one
he had led them on that eventful day when he
had unearthed the Dragon&#8217;s Secret. Never
once did he allow them to lay a finger on his
prize, though, panting and disgusted, they pursued
him hither and yon, sometimes so close
that he was well within their reach, sometimes
with him far in advance. Occasionally he
would lie down with the fish between his paws,
fairly inviting them to come and help themselves.
Which they had no sooner attempted,
than he was up and away again.
</p>
<p>The man wisely took no part in the struggle,
but stood looking on, encouraging them with
half-rueful, half-laughing remarks. At length
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
Leslie had an inspiration. While Rags was
standing at the edge of the water, panting
from a long and furious run, the fish reposing
at his feet, she seized a small board lying near,
called to him beguilingly and hurled the board
out into the sea.
</p>
<p>Here was a game that was even more fascinating.
Rags always adored it. Forsaking
the much-sought fish, he leaped into the
lazy waves and swam out toward his new prize,
while the stranger eagerly seized the fish and
concealed it in his basket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so sorry!&#8221; apologized Leslie. &#8220;I
know he has spoiled it now. I hope you can
forgive us for this dreadful thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of the sort!&#8221; laughed the stranger.
&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t harmed it a bit, for it was only the
head he had hold of. When it&#8217;s washed and
cooked, that beauty will taste just as good as if
it had never had the adventure. My, but
that&#8217;s a fearsome animal of yours! I
wouldn&#8217;t want to tackle him. But those
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
English sheep-dogs are noted for being wonderful
protectors and very interesting pets besides.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And just to show that he bore Rags no malice,
he picked up the board which the dog had
retrieved, and obligingly hurled it into the
surf again. Rags ecstatically pursued it once
more, dropped it at the man&#8217;s feet, and begged
for another opportunity. But just before it
was launched a third time, he spied a hermit-crab
scuttling away almost under his nose,
forsook his latest diversion, and was off on another
hunt.
</p>
<p>The man laughed, dropped the wet, sandy
board, dusted off his hands by striking them
together, picked up his fishing-kit, hung his
camp-stool over his arm, bade the girls good
afternoon, and strode away.
</p>
<p>They gazed after him a moment and were
about to turn back toward their own part of
the beach, when Leslie suddenly seized Phyllis&#8217;s
arm in a vice-like grip.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Phyllis, Phyllis, don&#8217;t think me crazy!
Something has just come to me. The way
that man threw the board just now and dusted
off his hands and then walked away&mdash;was just&mdash;exactly
like&mdash;the <i>man with the limp</i> that
morning at dawn! The action was identical.
I&#8217;m positive I&#8217;m not mistaken. And he looks
just like him, the same height and build and
all, as he walked away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, my dear child, <i>he doesn&#8217;t limp</i>!&#8221; cried
Phyllis, conclusively. &#8220;So you certainly are
mistaken!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know he doesn&#8217;t, but I&mdash;don&#8217;t care.
He&#8217;s the same one. I am absolutely sure of
it. Maybe he&#8217;s all over the limp now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But though Leslie was so certain, Phyllis remained
unconvinced!
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>OUT OF THE HURRICANE</h3>
</div>

<p>With the fickleness of October weather
(which is often as freakish as that of
April), the golden afternoon had turned
cloudy and raw before the girls returned home.
By nightfall it was raining, and a rising, gusty
wind had ruffled the ocean into lumpy, foam-crested
waves. At seven o&#8217;clock the wind had
increased to a heavy gale and was steadily
growing stronger. The threatened storm, as
usual, filled Miss Marcia with nervous forebodings,
and even Leslie experienced some uncomfortable
apprehensions during their supper
hour.
</p>
<p>At eight o&#8217;clock, Phyllis arrived, escorted
by Ted. &#8220;My!&#8221; she exclaimed, shaking the
raindrops from her clothes as she stood on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
porch, &#8220;but this is going to be a night! Father
says the papers have warnings that we should
probably get the tail-end of a West Indian
hurricane that was headed this way, and I guess
it has come! It&#8217;s getting worse every minute.
Have you seen how the tide is rising? Get on
your things and come down to the beach. Ted
brought me, because I could hardly stand up
against the wind. He&#8217;s going back presently.
Come and see how the water is rising!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hush!&#8221; implored Leslie, glancing nervously
toward her aunt. &#8220;You&#8217;ve no idea
how upset Aunt Marcia is already,&#8221; she
whispered. &#8220;She&#8217;ll be distracted if she gets
an idea there&#8217;s any danger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me!&#8221; returned Phyllis, contritely.
&#8220;I really didn&#8217;t think, for a moment. Father
says there probably isn&#8217;t any real danger.
The tide has almost never risen as far as these
bungalows, except in winter; and if the worst
comes to the worst, we can always get out of
them and walk away. But this threatens to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
be the worst storm of the kind we&#8217;ve had in
years. Are you coming down to see the
water?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If Aunt Marcia doesn&#8217;t mind. But if
she&#8217;s afraid to be left alone, I won&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Ted will be here, and we&#8217;ll just run
down for a minute or two. It&#8217;s really a great
sight!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ted very thoughtfully offered to stay, and
the two girls, wrapped to the eyes, pushed
through the blinding rain and wind down to
where the breakers were pounding their way
up the beach, spreading, when they broke, farther
and farther inland. So terrific was the
impact of the wind, that the girls had to turn
their backs to it when they wanted to speak.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I brought you out here, as much as anything,
because I had something to say,&#8221;
shouted Phyllis, her voice scarcely audible to
the girl close beside her. &#8220;If the tide keeps
on like this, it will probably wash away what
we&#8217;ve hidden by the old log. And probably
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
others who are concerned with that may be
thinking of the same thing. We&#8217;ve got to
keep a close watch. I believe things are going
to happen to-night!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you think we&#8217;d better dig it
up ourselves, right away?&#8221; suggested Leslie.
&#8220;We can&#8217;t very well go out to do it later when
it may be necessary, and surely you want to
save it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly <i>not</i>!&#8221; declared Phyllis. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
care if it <i>is</i> washed away. What I want
is the fun of seeing the other parties breaking
their necks to rescue it. If it&#8217;s washed away
they&#8217;ll think the real article has disappeared,
and then we&#8217;ll see what next! Let&#8217;s take one
more look at the surf and then go back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They peered out for a moment into the awe-inspiring
blackness where an angry ocean was
eating into the beach. Then, battling back
against the wind, they returned to the house.
Ted, having ascertained that there was no further
service he could render, suggested that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
he had better go back and help his father stop
a leak in the roof of Fisherman&#8217;s Luck, which
had suddenly proved unseaworthy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad Phyllis will be with us to-night,&#8221;
Miss Marcia told him, &#8220;for I&#8217;m very
little company for Leslie at a time like this. I
get so nervous that I have to take a sedative
the doctor has given me for emergencies, and
that generally puts me pretty soundly to
sleep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They sat about the open fire after Ted had
gone, listening to the commotion of the elements
outside and talking fitfully. Every
few moments Miss Marcia would rise, go to
the window, and peer out nervously into the
darkness. Once the telephone-bell rang and
every one jumped. Leslie hurried to answer
it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s Aunt Sally Blake!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;She wants to know how we all are and if we
happen to have seen anything of Eileen. She
was at the hospital all the afternoon, but she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
hasn&#8217;t returned. Aunt Sally &#8217;phoned the
hospital, but they said Miss Ramsay had left
three hours ago. She&#8217;s terribly worried about
her&mdash;thinks she may have had an accident in
this storm. She thought it just possible
Eileen might have come on out here. I said
no, but would call her up later and see if she&#8217;d
had news.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This latest turn of affairs added in no wise
to Miss Marcia&#8217;s peace of mind. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t
you take your powder now, Aunt Marcia, and
go to bed,&#8221; Leslie suggested at last. &#8220;It&#8217;s
only worrying you to sit up and watch this.
There&#8217;s no danger, and you might as well go
peacefully to sleep and forget it. Phyllis and
I will stay up quite a while yet, and if there&#8217;s
any reason for it, we will wake you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Marcia herself thought well of the plan
and was soon in bed, and, having taken her
sleeping-powder, the good lady was shortly
fast and dreamlessly asleep, much to the relief
of the girls.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And now let&#8217;s go into your room and
watch,&#8221; whispered Phyllis. &#8220;I&#8217;m just as certain
as I can be that something is going to happen
to-night!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They arranged themselves, each at a window,
Phyllis at the one toward the sea; Leslie
facing Curlew&#8217;s Nest, and began an exciting
vigil. With the electric light switched off, it
was so black, both inside and out, that it
would have been difficult to distinguish anything,
but with the windows shut and encrusted
with wind-blown sand, it was utterly
impossible. And when they dared to open
them even a crack, the rain poured in and
drenched them. They could do this only at intervals.
Even Rags seemed to share the general
uneasiness, and could find no comfortable
spot in which to dispose himself, but kept
hovering between the two windows continually.
</p>
<p>It was Leslie who suddenly spoke in a
hushed whisper. She had just opened her
window the merest crack and peeped out, then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
closed it again without sound. &#8220;Phyllis, come
here a moment. Look out when I open the
window. It struck me that I saw something&mdash;some
dark shape&mdash;slip around the corner
of the house next door. See if you can see
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Phyllis applied her eye to the crack when
the window was opened. Then she drew her
head back with a jerk. &#8220;I certainly did see
something!&#8221; she whispered excitedly. &#8220;It
slipped back to the other side of the bungalow!&#8221;
She peered out again. &#8220;Good gracious! I
see it again&mdash;or else it&#8217;s another one.
Doesn&#8217;t seem quite like the first figure. Can
there possibly be two?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie then, becoming impatient, demanded
a turn at the peep-hole, and while she was
straining her gaze into the darkness, they were
both electrified by a light, timid knock at the
door of the front veranda.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who can <i>that</i> be?&#8221; cried Leslie, wide-eyed
and trembling.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s Ted come back,&#8221; ventured
Phyllis. &#8220;At any rate, I suppose we&#8217;ll have
to go and see!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rags, alert also, uttered a low growl, and
Leslie silenced him anxiously. &#8220;If this
arouses Aunt Marcia,&#8221;&mdash;she whispered, &#8220;I
shall be awfully worried. Be quiet, Rags!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They tiptoed into the living-room, switched
on the light, and advanced to the door. Again
the knock came, light but insistent; and without
further hesitation, Leslie threw the door
open.
</p>
<p>A muffled, dripping figure inquired timidly,
&#8220;Please may I come in? I&#8217;m dripping wet
and chilled to the bone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, <i>Eileen</i>!&#8221; cried Leslie, &#8220;what are you
doing here in this terrible storm?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I got lost on the way back from the hospital,&#8221;
half sobbed the new-comer, &#8220;and I must
have motored round and round in the rain and
dark. And at last something went wrong
with the engine, and I got out and left the car
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
on the road&mdash;and I walked and walked&mdash;trying
to find some place to stay&mdash;and at last I
found I was right near here&mdash;so I came in!&#8221;
She seemed exhausted and half hysterical and
Leslie could not but believe her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re found and here!&#8221;
she cried. &#8220;I must call up Aunt Sally right
away and tell her you&#8217;re all right. She called
a while ago and was so anxious about you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie went to the telephone, while Phyllis
helped Eileen to rid herself of her wet clothes
and get into something dry. Then they all
sat down by the fire in an uneasy silence.
Presently Phyllis suggested that Eileen might
like something warm to eat and drink, as she
had evidently had no dinner. She assented
to this eagerly, and the two girls went to the
kitchen to provide something for her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you,&#8221; whispered Phyllis, &#8220;I just
can&#8217;t believe that hospital and getting-lost
stuff! She came out here for some purpose,
you mark my word! But why she wants to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
get in here is beyond me just yet. I&#8217;ll find
out later, though, you see if I don&#8217;t!&#8221;
</p>
<p>When they entered the living-room with a
dainty tray a few minutes later, they found
Eileen standing by one of the windows facing
the ocean, trying vainly to peer into the outer
blackness. She started guiltily when she saw
them and retreated to the fire, murmuring
something about &#8220;the awful night.&#8221; But
though she had seemed so eager for food, she
ate almost nothing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you take a little of this hot soup?&#8221;
urged Leslie. &#8220;It will do you so much good.
You must be very hungry by now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thanks, so much!&#8221; Eileen replied, with
a grateful glance. &#8220;You are very good to me.
I did really think I was hungry, at first, but
I&#8217;m so nervous I just can&#8217;t eat!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She pushed the tray aside and began to
roam restlessly about the room. At every
decent excuse, such as an extra heavy gust of
wind or a flapping of the shutters, she would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
hurry to the window and try to peer out.
</p>
<p>At length Phyllis made an excuse to disappear
into Leslie&#8217;s room and was gone quite
a time. Suddenly she put her head out of the
door into the living-room and remarked, in a
voice full of suppressed excitement: &#8220;Leslie,
can you come here a moment?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie excused herself and ran to join
Phyllis. &#8220;What is it?&#8221; she whispered breathlessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out of the front window!&#8221; returned
Phyllis, in a hushed undertone. &#8220;There&#8217;s
something queer going on outside&mdash;by the old
log!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie opened the window a crack. The
howl of the storm and the lash of rain was appalling,
and it was two or three minutes before
she could accustom her sight to the outer blackness.
But when she did manage to distinguish
something, she was startled to observe
not only one, but <i>two</i> dark figures circling
slowly round and round the log, like two animals
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
after the same prey, and watching each
other cautiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s not all!&#8221; muttered Phyllis, behind
her. &#8220;There&#8217;s a third figure standing in
the shadow right by Curlew&#8217;s Nest. I saw
him out of the side window. What on earth
can it all mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>So absorbed were they that neither of them
noticed the form that slipped into the room
behind them and stood peering over their
shoulders. But they were suddenly startled
beyond words to hear Eileen, close behind
them, catch her breath with an indrawn hiss,
and mutter involuntarily:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>Ted!</i>&mdash;Be careful!&mdash;Look out!&mdash;<i>Look
out!</i>&mdash;&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>RAGS TO THE RESCUE</h3>
</div>

<p>Phyllis whirled about. &#8220;What is the
matter? Why do you say that?&#8221; she demanded
in a fierce whisper.
</p>
<p>Eileen shrank back, evidently appalled by
what she had unconsciously revealed. &#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;didn&#8217;t
mean anything!&#8221; she stammered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly did!&#8221; Phyllis declared.
&#8220;You said something about &#8216;Ted.&#8217; Who <i>is</i>
&#8216;Ted,&#8217; and what is going on outside there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know!&mdash;I&#8217;m not&mdash;sure! I&#8217;m
dreadfully nervous&mdash;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here!&#8221; cried Phyllis, with stern determination,
&#8220;I believe you know a great deal
more than you will acknowledge. You&#8217;ve
said something about &#8216;Ted.&#8217; Now, I have a
brother Ted, and I&#8217;ve reason to think he has
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
been mixed up with some of your affairs. I
wish you would kindly explain it all. I think
there&#8217;s some trouble&mdash;out there!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t&mdash;I oughtn&#8217;t,&#8221; Eileen moaned;
when suddenly Leslie, who had glanced again
out of the window, uttered a half-suppressed
cry:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there <i>is</i> something wrong! They&#8217;re&mdash;they&#8217;re
struggling together&mdash;for something!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Both of the other girls rushed to the window
and peered out over her shoulder. There was
indeed something decidedly exciting going on.
The two figures who had been circling about
the old log, watching each other like a couple
of wild animals, were now wrestling together
in a fierce encounter. How it had come about,
the girls did not know, as none of them had
been looking out when it began. But it was
plainly a struggle for the possession of something
that one of them had clutched tightly in
his hand. Vaguely they could see it, dangling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
about, as the contest went on. And each,
in her secret heart, knew it to be the burlap
bag&mdash;and its contents!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eileen!&#8221; cried Phyllis, turning sharply
upon the other girl, &#8220;is one of those two&mdash;my
brother Ted? Answer me&mdash;truthfully.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;oh, yes!&#8221; panted Eileen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And is he in&mdash;danger?&#8221; persisted Phyllis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;I&#8217;m afraid so!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m going out to help him!&#8221; declared
Phyllis, courageously. &#8220;Come, Leslie&mdash;and
bring Rags!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leslie never afterward knew how it happened&mdash;that
she, a naturally timid person,
should have walked out of that house, unhesitatingly
and unquestioningly, to do battle with
some unknown enemy in the storm and the
dark. If she had had any time to think about
it, she might have faltered. But Phyllis gave
her no time. With Rags at their heels, they
snatched up some wraps and all suddenly burst
out of the front door onto the veranda, Phyllis
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
having stopped only long enough to take up
her electric torch from the living-room table.
She switched this on in the darkness, and,
guided by its light, they plunged into the
storm.
</p>
<p>The force of the wind almost took their
breath away. And as they plowed along, Leslie
was horrified to notice that the tide had
crept almost up to the level of the old log and
was within sixty feet of the bungalow. &#8220;Oh,
what <i>shall</i> we do if it comes much higher!&#8221; she
moaned to herself. But from that moment on,
she had little time for such considerations.
</p>
<p>Phyllis had plunged ahead with the light,
and the two other girls followed her in the
shadow. Leslie was somewhat hampered in
her advance, as she was holding Rags by his
collar and he strongly objected to the restraint.
But she dared not let him loose just then.
</p>
<p>Suddenly they were plunged in utter darkness.
Phyllis&#8217;s torch had given out! And the
two others, reaching her side at that instant,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
heard her gasp, &#8220;Oh, dreadful! Can anything
be the matter with this battery?&#8221; But after a
moment&#8217;s manipulation the light flashed on
again. It was in this instant that they saw
the face of Ted, lying on the ground and staring
up at them while his assailant held him
firmly pinned beneath him in an iron grip.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Help!&#8221; shrieked Ted, above the roar of the
wind. &#8220;Let Rags loose!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They needed no other signal. Leslie released
her hold on the impatient animal, and
with a snarl that was almost unnerving, he
darted, straight as an arrow, for Ted&#8217;s assailant.
</p>
<p>The girls never knew the whole history of
that encounter. They only realized that Ted
finally emerged from a whirling medley of legs
and arms, limping but triumphant, and strove
to loosen the dog&#8217;s grip on a man who was
begging to be released.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do, Rags, old boy! You&#8217;ve done
the trick! Good old fellow! Now you can
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
let go!&#8221; he shouted at the dog, trying to persuade
him to loosen his hold. But Rags was
obdurate. He could see no point in giving up
the struggle at this interesting juncture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Call him off!&#8221; Ted shouted to the girls,
&#8220;I can&#8217;t make him let go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it <i>safe?</i>&#8221; cried Phyllis, in answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to take a chance!&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;He&#8217;s half killing this fellow!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With beating heart Leslie came into the
range of the light, grasped Rags by the collar
and pulled at him with all her might. &#8220;Come
Rags! Let go! It&#8217;s all right!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The dog gave way reluctantly. And when
he had at length loosed his terrible grip and
was safely in Leslie&#8217;s custody, the man scrambled
to his feet, rose, held on to his arm with his
other hand, and groaned.
</p>
<p>And, despite his disheveled condition and
his drenched appearance, in the glare of the
electric torch the girls recognized him, with a
start of amazement. It was the fisherman of
the afternoon&mdash;the man with the former limp!

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></div>
<p>He turned immediately on Ted with an
angry, impatient gesture. &#8220;Well, the other
fellow got it&mdash;after all! I don&#8217;t know what
business <i>you</i> had in this concern, but you
spoiled the trick for me&mdash;and didn&#8217;t do yourself
any good! And if that dog gives me
hydrophobia, I&#8217;ll sue the whole outfit of you!
He beat it off in that direction&mdash;the other fellow.
I saw that much. I can&#8217;t lose any time,
though what I need is a doctor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And with another angry snort, he disappeared
into the darkness and the hurricane.

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>EILEEN EXPLAINS</h3>
</div>

<p>It was an amazed, bewildered, and sheepish
group that faced each other in the light of
the electric torch after the departure of the
unknown man. Phyllis was the first to recover
self-possession.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we might as well go indoors,&#8221; she
remarked, in her decided way. &#8220;There&#8217;s evidently
nothing to be gained by staying out
here in the storm!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The others, still too benumbed in mind to
have any initiative of their own, followed her
obediently. Only when they were at the door
did Leslie arouse to the immediate urgencies.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do please be very quiet and not wake Aunt
Marcia!&#8221; she begged. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid the effect
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
on her would be very bad if she were to realize
all that has happened here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They entered the bungalow on tiptoe, removed
their drenched wraps, and sank down
in the nearest chairs by the dying fire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; remarked Phyllis, constituting
herself spokesman, as she threw on a fresh log
and some smaller sticks, &#8220;we&#8217;d be awfully
obliged to you, Ted and Eileen, if you&#8217;ll kindly
explain what this mystery is all about!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why under the sun <i>you</i> had to
come butting into it!&#8221; muttered Ted, resentfully,
nursing some bruises he had sustained in
the recent fray.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please remember,&#8221; retorted Phyllis, &#8220;that
if I hadn&#8217;t come butting into it&mdash;and Leslie
and Rags,&mdash;you&#8217;d probably be very much the
worse for wear at this moment!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so! Forgive me, old girl! You <i>did</i>
do a fine piece of work&mdash;all of you. I&#8217;m just
sore because the thing turned out so&mdash;badly.
But what I really meant was that I can&#8217;t see
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
how you got mixed up in it at all&mdash;from the
very beginning, I mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s precisely what we think about
<i>you</i>!&#8221; laughed Phyllis. &#8220;We&#8217;ve felt all along
as if it were <i>our</i> affair and that <i>you</i> were interfering.
So I think we&#8217;d better have explanations
all around!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, as a matter of fact, it&#8217;s Eileen&#8217;s affair,
most of all, so I think she&#8217;d better do her
explaining first,&#8221; Ted offered as a solution of
the tangle.
</p>
<p>They all looked toward Eileen, sitting
cowered over the fire, and she answered their
look with a startled gaze of her own.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know whether I ought!&#8221; she
faltered, turning to Ted. &#8220;Do you think I
ought?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;d better!&#8221; he declared. &#8220;It&#8217;s
got to a point where these folks seem to have
some inside information of their own that perhaps
might be valuable to you. How they got
it, I can&#8217;t think. At any rate, there&#8217;ll be no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
harm done by it, I can vouch for that. So&mdash;just
fire away!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Thus adjured, Eileen drew a long breath
and said hesitantly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I really don&#8217;t know just where to begin.
A lot of it is just as much a mystery to me as
it is to you. I think you all have heard that I
have a grandfather who is very ill, in a hospital
over in Branchville. He is the Honorable
Arthur Ramsay, of Norwich, England.
He has been for many years a traveler and
explorer in China and India and Tibet.
Early this year he had a severe attack of Indian
fever and could not seem to recuperate, so he
started for England, coming by way of the
Pacific and America. When he got to the
Atlantic coast, this last summer, some one
recommended that he should try staying a few
weeks at this beach; so he took a bungalow and
spent part of the summer and autumn here,
and thought he was much benefited.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do excuse me for interrupting!&#8221; exclaimed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
Phyllis; &#8220;but was the bungalow he rented Curlew&#8217;s
Nest?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; hesitated Eileen, with a startled
glance at her &#8220;it&mdash;it was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, do you mind telling me how it was
that the name was so different?&#8221; persisted
Phyllis. &#8220;Mrs. Danforth understood that she
rented it to a Mr. Horatio Gaines.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that was because Grandfather didn&#8217;t
want it in his own name, because, you see, he&#8217;s
a rather well-known person in England and
even over here, and he needed a complete rest,
with no danger of having to be interviewed or
called upon or anything like that. So he had
his man, Geoffrey Horatio Gaines, hire the
place, and transact all the business here in <i>his</i>
name. It saved Grandfather a lot of trouble,
for Geoffrey simply took charge of everything;
and as Grandfather never went among people
here, no one was the wiser.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After he left the cottage, he expected to
go to New York and remain there till he sailed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
for home. And he <i>did</i> go there for a few days,
but his health at once grew worse, so he returned
to the beach. Of course, the bungalow
was closed by that time, so he took rooms at
the hotel, farther along. It was there that I
joined him. I had come over here with friends
of Mother&#8217;s, earlier in the summer, and had
been visiting at their summer camp in the
Adirondacks until I should join Grandfather
and return to England with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t been with him more than two or
three days when I realized that something
had gone awfully wrong, somehow or other.
Grandfather was worried and upset about
something, and he began to watch his mail
and be anxious to avoid meeting any one. He
couldn&#8217;t or wouldn&#8217;t explain things to me,
but had long interviews with his man, Geoffrey,
who has been with him for years and years and
whom he trusts completely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At last, one awfully stormy night, about
two weeks ago, Geoffrey disappeared, and has
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
never been seen or heard of since. We can&#8217;t
imagine what has become of him. And the
next day Grandfather was so worried about
him and the other troubles that a cold he had
ran into a severe attack of pneumonia. Of
course, it wasn&#8217;t feasible for him to remain
at the hotel, especially as it was soon to close,
so he had himself taken to the nearest good
hospital, which happened to be this one at
Branchville. Since he didn&#8217;t have Geoffrey
to wait on him, he wanted to be where he could
have the best attention and nursing, and as I
could run his car, which Geoffrey had always
done, I could get easily there to see him.
Then, as you probably know, the hotel closed
for the season, and the manager very kindly
found me a place to stay&mdash;with Aunt Sally
Blake&mdash;in the village. She has been very good
and kind to me, but I expect I&#8217;ve worried her
a lot, not because I didn&#8217;t care, but because
I couldn&#8217;t help it and I couldn&#8217;t tell her about&mdash;things!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But, oh! I have been so troubled&mdash;so fairly
<i>desperate</i>, at times! You cannot even guess
the awful burden I&#8217;ve had to bear&mdash;and all
alone,&mdash;at least till I came quite by accident
to know your brother Ted. He has helped
me so much&mdash;but that is another part of the
story!
</p>
<p>&#8220;One night Grandfather&#8217;s fever was very
high and he was delirious. I begged his nurse
to let me sit with him awhile, and I heard him
constantly muttering about the bungalow, and
Geoffrey hiding something there, and it being
safe at Curlew&#8217;s Nest, and a lot more half-incoherent
remarks of that kind. Next morning
he was a little better and in his right mind
again, so I asked him what he had meant by
the things he had talked about the night before.
And then he said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Eileen, I&#8217;ll have to trust you with some
of the secret, I believe, since you&#8217;ve overheard
what you have. Perhaps you may even be able
to help, and of course I can trust you to keep
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
your own counsel&mdash;absolutely. There&#8217;s been
a very mysterious mix-up here, and it involves
far more than you may imagine. In fact, it
might even become an affair of international
moment&mdash;if something is not found, and
quickly too. The gist of the matter is this:
while I was in China last year, I had some informal
correspondence with an official very
high in government circles there, concerning
his attitude in regard to the province of Shantung.
As he was inclined to be very friendly
toward me at the time he was just a little expansive
and indiscreet (I think those were
Grandfather&#8217;s words) in regard to his Government&#8217;s
plans. Later, I think, he regretted
this, and made some half-joking overtures to
have his letters returned. But I pretended not
to understand him and the matter was dropped.
As a matter of fact, I thought them too suggestive
and important to my own Government to
part with them!&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is these letters that are the heart of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
whole trouble, Grandfather says. He heard
nothing more about them till he came to stay
at the hotel here. Then he received a very
threatening letter, declaring that if this packet
was not returned to the writer, serious consequences
would result. It didn&#8217;t say <i>what</i> consequences,
but Grandfather suspected they
might even go as far as an attempt on his life.
But he was determined not to give up the letters.
You see, they concerned a matter that
might involve his own country with China,
and he felt they should be delivered to his own
Government. Beside that, he is just stubborn
enough not to be bullied into anything by
threats.
</p>
<p>&#8220;His man Geoffrey tried to persuade him
to put the letters in a safe-deposit vault in
New York, but Grandfather says he is old-fashioned
in some things and doesn&#8217;t trust
even to safe-deposit boxes&mdash;says he prefers to
keep things he values in his own possession.
He had the letters in a queer little bronze box
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
that was given him, years ago, by the late Empress
Dowager of China. It had a secret lock
that was quite impossible to open unless one
knew the trick. He carried this in his pocket,
and slept with it under his pillow at night, and
felt perfectly safe about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Here Eileen paused a moment for breath,
and the two other girls glanced at each other
guiltily, but they said nothing. Then Eileen
went on:
</p>
<p>&#8220;One night, just after I came, there was an
attempt to rob him at the hotel. The attempt
failed because Geoffrey happened to be awake
and discovered some one prowling about
Grandfather&#8217;s sitting-room. Whoever it was
escaped through the window without even his
face being seen, and there was no trace of him
later. Grandfather made Geoffrey keep the
thing quiet and not report it to the hotel, because
he didn&#8217;t want any publicity about the
matter. But he decided then that it would be
safer to have the thing hidden somewhere for a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
time&mdash;in some place where no one would dream
of hunting for it. And it struck him that
down at the bungalow where he had spent those
quiet weeks, and which he supposed was all
shut up and deserted, would be as unlikely a
spot as any to be suspected of hiding such a
thing. He supposed that the one next door&mdash;this
one&mdash;was closed also, or I do not think
he would have considered that hiding-place.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So the next night, which happened to be
one when there was a very hard storm, he sent
Geoffrey down to the bungalow with the little
box containing the letters. He did not wish
him to take the car, as it might be too conspicuous,
but had him go on foot. Geoffrey had
found out, during the summer, that one could
get into that place through a door at the side
by working at the hook through the crack with
a knife-blade, and he intended to get into the
cottage and conceal the box in some out-of-the-way
hiding-place there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But here is where the mystery begins.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
Geoffrey set off that night, but has never been
seen or heard of since. What has happened to
him, we cannot imagine, unless he was caught
and taken a prisoner by some one concerned
in getting those letters. If he had been killed,
we would surely know it. Yet if he were alive,
it seems as if we should have heard from him,
somehow. He was a most devoted and faithful
and trustworthy soul, so we are sure that
something must have happened to him&mdash;that he
is being detained somewhere. Grandfather is
quite certain that he is guarding the secret of
that box, somehow, and that it would be best
to wait till he comes back or sends us some
word.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What Grandfather asked me to do was to
run out here in the car some day, and, if there
was no one about, to scout around and see if
I could discover any clue to the mystery, without
attracting attention. He supposed, of
course, that the beach was by that time entirely
deserted. I came out the very next day, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
found to my disgust that the cottage next door
was occupied&mdash;by you, as I now know! But
I felt it would not be wise to be seen about here
in the daytime, so, without saying anything to
Grandfather (who would be awfully upset if
he knew it), I determined to run out about ten
o&#8217;clock that night and scout around when you
people would probably be in bed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And here is where Ted comes into it! I
got here that night as I had planned, found no
one about, and tried the experiment of getting
into the side door, as Grandfather had explained,
but I found it very difficult; in fact,
quite impossible&mdash;for <i>me!</i> And while I was
fussing with it, I was suddenly startled by a
low voice, right behind me, inquiring <i>very</i> politely
what I was trying to do! It was Ted,
here, who had been out for a stroll, and happening
to catch a glimpse of me at this very
peculiar occupation, and naturally thinking I
was a burglar, had come up unobserved to find
out about it!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You can just imagine what an <i>awful</i> position
it was for me! I did not know what to
say or what to do. I know that, legally, I
had no business there, and if he were inclined
to make a fuss about it, he could have me arrested.
I literally almost went out of my mind
at that moment. But I guess something must
have made him feel that I wasn&#8217;t really a
&#8216;lady burglar&#8217; or anything of that sort, for he
just said, very kindly, &#8216;If you are in trouble,
perhaps I can help you!&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see how he could possibly help me
unless he knew the whole story, and I thought
I ought not tell any one <i>that!</i> But unless I
did, I was certainly in a very terrible position.
So I suddenly made up my mind it would have
to be done, for something made me feel he was
honorable and trustworthy, and that the secret
would be safe with him. What made me feel
all the more sure was that he mentioned that
he was staying up the beach at his father&#8217;s
bungalow, and had happened to be out for a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
walk and had seen me there. I know he said
it to make me feel easier, and that everything
was all right.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I told him as much as I could of the
story. And when he had heard it, he said:
&#8216;I happen to know all about opening that door,
because I know the people who own the cottage
very well. Perhaps you had better let
me try.&#8217; I said I&#8217;d be only too glad to, and
he had the door unfastened in a moment.
Then he told me to go in and examine the
place all I wished to and he would watch outside.
If I needed any help, I could call and
he would come in and do what he could for
me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I went in and examined the whole
place with my electric torch, but I could not
discover a single thing except that one of the
bricks in the fireplace had been partly loosened
and a broken knife-blade was in the corner of
the chimney-place. It was the only thing I
could see to show that possibly Geoffrey had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
been there. I thought the knife-blade looked
like one I had seen him use.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But as I didn&#8217;t see a sign of the bronze box,
I knew it was useless to stay any longer, so I
came out. Ted fastened the door again, went
with me to the car, which I had left down the
road, and offered to give me any further help
he could, at any time. He promised to keep
the secret from every one, and said that he
would make an even more thorough search
over Curlew&#8217;s Nest, if I wished, because he had
much better opportunity to do so. Of course,
I agreed to that and went on back to Aunt
Sally&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two days later, Ted saw my car going
along one of the back roads near the village,
signaled to me, and told me that, the day before,
he had caught you girls coming out of
Curlew&#8217;s Nest and that you acted rather guilty
and refused to explain what you had been in
there for. He told me that you might possibly
suspect something, and to steer clear of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
you if we should happen to encounter each
other, as it is always likely that people will,
in this town. He described what you both
looked like, so that I couldn&#8217;t fail to know you.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And, sure enough, I met you both that very
morning, in Mrs. Selby&#8217;s little store, and I
expect you think I acted in a perfectly abominable
manner. I just hated to do it, for I
liked the looks of you both, but I felt I must
take no chances. Ted also told me that he had
been in Curlew&#8217;s Nest the night before and had
gone over the place very carefully once more,
but had found nothing except a string of beads
that had been torn from the fringe of my girdle
that other night, and had been lying on the
floor. I remember that the girdle caught when
I was looking under one of the bureaus. He
also gave me the broken penknife-blade to
keep, as he said it was best to leave nothing
around there that any one else could discover
and use as a clue.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A day or two later I met you, Phyllis, at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
Aunt Sally&#8217;s and she <i>would</i> insist on introducing
us, though I could see you were no more
anxious to make the acquaintance, after the
way I&#8217;d acted, than I was. But I encountered
Ted again that afternoon, and he said
he had hunted me up to tell me he had news
and also a plan that he wanted to suggest. He
said he had noticed, during the last two or three
days, a strange man who seemed to haunt the
beach, just a short way off and out of sight
of the two bungalows. The man seemed to be
a very ardent fisherman,&mdash;and an expert one,
too,&mdash;but Ted had noticed that he kept a very
sharp lookout toward the bungalows when he
thought no one was around to see. He suspected
that perhaps this man had something to
do with the mystery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The plan he suggested was that I get acquainted
with you girls, after all, in some way
that seemed the most natural, but without letting
you know that I was also acquainted with
<i>him</i>. And when I had done so, I had better
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
offer to take you all out for a long drive in
the car and keep you away a good while, and
give him a chance to see what this man was up
to&mdash;if anything.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The getting acquainted was easy, and you
all know how I managed <i>that</i>&mdash;and also the
ride, a day or two later. When I was returning
from the ride that night, at dusk, Ted
signaled me from the bushes near Curlew&#8217;s
Nest, jumped into the car, and told me what
had happened in the afternoon. He had gone
off to the village first, then hurried back,
slipped up here by way of the creek, and hidden
himself in a clump of rushes across the
road. Just as he had suspected, he saw his
suspicious fisherman sneak up here after a
while, scout around the outside of the bungalow,
disappear into it for a time, by the side
door, come out, apparently empty-handed,
stare at the outside again for a long time, and
then at your bungalow, and finally disappear.
But that was not all.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He waited where he was a few minutes,
thinking possibly the man might come back,
and he was just about to come out, when along
came an automobile with <i>two</i> men in it, which
stopped directly in front of Curlew&#8217;s Nest.
He could not see their faces, for they had
slouch hats pulled far down on their heads.
They got out and walked about a bit, evidently
to see if any one was around. Then, thinking
themselves alone, they hurried up to the bungalow,
worked at the side door, and finally got in.
Shortly after, they came out again and walked
down to the beach, where he could not see them.
Then they came back, got into the car, and
drove off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By that time it was growing so late that
he concluded he would stay where he was and
wait for me to come back, which he did. Before
he left me, we had a slight breakdown,
and in helping me fix it, he hurt his hand. But
that same night, long after midnight, he got
into Curlew&#8217;s Nest again to see if he could find
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
out what had happened, and he found a very
strange message left on the table&mdash;a type-written
warning to the one who had taken the
article (as it was called!) from its hiding-place
to return it, and underneath, a printed note in
pencil, saying it would be returned. He
thought probably the first man had left the
type-written part, and the other two had
printed the answer underneath. That was all
he could make of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was all very mysterious, but while we
couldn&#8217;t make much out of it, at least it showed
that something concerning the affair was going
on and that the place must be closely watched.
Ted volunteered to keep this watch. Meanwhile,
Grandfather had had a very bad turn
and I was with him constantly. He was terribly
depressed over the whole affair. Even
his doctor, who knows nothing about this, said
he was evidently worrying about something,
and if the cause of worry were not removed,
he doubted the possibility of recovery. Tonight
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
I stayed with him later than usual, and
in returning, actually did lose my way in the
storm. But when I at last discovered where
I was, I knew that it was not far from here
and could not resist the temptation to come
over and see if anything was happening. I
found Ted also scouting around, and suddenly
we realized that some one else was on the
ground too, though we could not tell <i>who</i>, in
the darkness and rain. But Ted thought it
very dangerous for me to be out there, so he
made me come in here, as I did. And I need
not tell you what happened after that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eileen ceased speaking, and Phyllis had just
opened her lips to say something when there
was a knock at the door. All four jumped
nervously, but Ted got up and went to open
it.
</p>
<p>To their immense alarm, the opened door
revealed the figure of&mdash;&#8220;the man with the
limp!&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE DRAGON GIVES UP THE SECRET</h3>
</div>

<p>THE man also started back at the sight of
all four of them together. And Rags,
who had been drying himself quietly by the
fire, rose with a snarl and leaped toward his
enemy of the earlier part of the evening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Heavens! don&#8217;t let that animal loose on me
again!&#8221; cried the man, backing off. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
just been down to the village doctor and had
my arm cauterized, as it is. I stopped in to
tell you something you&#8217;d better know. Probably
you haven&#8217;t noticed it, if you haven&#8217;t
looked out recently. The water is rising rapidly
and will soon be very nearly up to your
bungalow. You may want to get out before it
sweeps under it!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></p>
<p>With a cry of alarm, they all leaped toward
the door, Ted grasping Rags firmly by the
collar. It was even as the man had said.
Peering through the darkness, they could see
the water spreading inward from a recent
breaker, only about twenty-five feet from the
veranda. And the next breaker spread in even
a few inches further.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>shall</i> we do?&#8221; cried Leslie. &#8220;Aunt
Marcia will be frightened to death if she knows
it, and how I&#8217;m to get her out of here in this
howling storm, or where I can take her, I can&#8217;t
imagine!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Ted had been critically examining the
weather. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Leslie!&#8221; he soothed
her. &#8220;The wind is shifting. I noticed just
now that it seemed to be around to the north
and is getting farther west also. That means
the storm is almost over. And the tide ought
to turn in ten minutes or so. It&#8217;s practically
at its highest now. Ten chances to one it
won&#8217;t rise more than a foot or two further.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
But we&#8217;ll keep watch, and if it does, we&#8217;ll get
your aunt out of here in Eileen&#8217;s car, which is
just down the road, and take her either to our
place or to the village. Our bungalow isn&#8217;t
likely to be damaged, as it&#8217;s farther up the
dune than these. Don&#8217;t worry!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Thus encouraged, Leslie turned indoors
again, and the man, who was still lingering on
the porch, remarked:
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it isn&#8217;t too much trouble, friends, I&#8217;d
like to come in for a minute or two and ask
you folks a few questions about that little
fracas this evening and how you came to be
mixed up in it. It&#8217;s all right and perfectly
proper!&#8221; he hastened to add, seeing their
startled glances. &#8220;I can show you my credentials.&#8221;
He opened his coat and exhibited a
shield on his vest&mdash;the shield of a detective of
the New York police force!
</p>
<p>So amazed were they that they could scarcely
reply, but the man took matters in his own
hands and walked into the house. And Leslie
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
never even thought to warn him to speak softly
because of Aunt Marcia!
</p>
<p>Unconsciously they grouped themselves
about him at the open fire. And Rags, now
that the obnoxious stranger had been admitted
to the house on a hospitable footing, made no
further demonstrations of enmity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Barnes&mdash;Detective Barnes of
the New York force,&#8221; he began, &#8220;and I&#8217;d like
to clear up one or two little puzzles here before
I go on with this business. It&#8217;s a rather
peculiar one. I heard this young gentleman
refer to a car that was standing in the road
near here and say it belonged to one of you
young ladies named Eileen. I&#8217;d like to inform
Miss Eileen that the party who got that
little article we were all scrapping for to-night,
jumped into her car when he got to the road,
tore like mad in it to the station, left it there,
and caught the express for New York. I
was just in time to see him disappearing in it,
but of course <i>I</i> had to walk to the village. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
suspected what he was going to do, though,
and I went straight to the station and found
the car standing there. So I took the liberty
of getting in it, driving myself to the village
doctor, and then back out here. You will find
your car, Miss Eileen, standing just where you
left it, but I thought you&#8217;d like to know it
had had the little adventure!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eileen opened her mouth to reply, but the
man gave her no chance, turning immediately
to Ted. &#8220;And as for you, young man, I suppose
you thought you were doing a wonderful
stunt when you landed into me to-night, just
as I&#8217;d unearthed the thing I&#8217;ve been on the
trail of for a week; but I&#8217;ll have to tell you
that you&#8217;ve spoiled one of the prettiest little
pieces of detective work I&#8217;ve undertaken for
several years, and may have helped to precipitate
a bit of international trouble, beside. I
don&#8217;t know what your motive was,&mdash;I suppose
you thought me a burglar,&mdash;but&mdash;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a moment!&#8221; cried Eileen, springing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
forward. &#8220;Tell me, why are you concerned in
this? My name is Ramsay and I have a right
to ask!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Detective Barnes was visibly startled.
&#8220;Are you a relative of the Honorable Arthur
Ramsay?&#8221; he demanded; and when she had
told him, he exclaimed: &#8220;Then you must know
all about Geoffrey Gaines and how he disappeared!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known him since I was a baby,&#8221; she
answered; &#8220;but how he disappeared is still an
awful mystery to us. My grandfather is very
ill in the Branchville hospital, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But didn&#8217;t he receive my letter?&#8221; cried Mr.
Barnes. &#8220;I sent it two days ago!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been too ill to read any mail for
the last two days,&#8221; replied Eileen, &#8220;and, of
course, I have not opened it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that explains why I haven&#8217;t heard
from him!&#8221; the man exclaimed, with a sigh of
relief. &#8220;Then I guess you will be interested
to hear that Gaines is alive and well, but kept
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
a close prisoner by some heathen Chinese in a
house on a west side street in New York.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how?&mdash;Why?&mdash;Did it happen the&mdash;the
night he&mdash;came down here?&#8221; she ventured.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you&#8217;re pretty well informed about
the matter,&#8221; he remarked cautiously. &#8220;And
if these others are equally so, I guess it&#8217;s safe
for me to go on and give you a history of the
thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eileen nodded, and he went on:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gaines and I used to know each other in
England, years before he entered your grandfather&#8217;s
service. In fact, we had been schoolmates
together. Then I came over to this
country and entered the detective service, and
he went into another walk of life. But we
kept in touch with each other by writing occasionally.
A week or so ago I was astonished
to receive a letter from him, written on all sorts
of odds and ends of paper and in an envelope
plainly manufactured by himself. It contained
some very singular news.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It gave me first the history of those letters
and how anxious your grandfather was to keep
hold of them. Then it told how he (Gaines)
had taken the box down here that night and
tried first to conceal it in the bungalow. But
no place in the house seemed safe enough to
him. He tried to dig up a brick in the fireplace
and bury it there, but gave it up after he
had broken his knife in the attempt. Then he
had the inspiration to bury it in the sand somewhere
outside, and he described where he <i>did</i>
locate it, right by that log. If Gaines had
known much about the tides here, he wouldn&#8217;t
have thought that a very good scheme. He
didn&#8217;t, though, and thought he&#8217;d found an
excellent place. He then turned to walk back
to the hotel, but hadn&#8217;t gone more than a mile
(it was storming hard, if you remember) when
a terrific blow on the back of the head knocked
him senseless. He never knew another thing
until he came to, after what must have been a
number of days, to find himself a prisoner in a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
house he judged to be somewhere in New York.
And from his description I&#8217;ve located it about
west Sixty-first street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He appeared to be in the keeping of a
Chinaman who dressed American fashion and
spoke good English. He was told that he was
a prisoner and that it was hopeless to try to
communicate with any one until he had reported
exactly where and how those letters had
been concealed. He begged for a day or two
to consider the matter and was granted it, but
told that if he did not comply with their wishes
he would disappear for good and no one would
ever be the wiser.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the meantime, he managed to get together
a few scraps of paper, and with the stub
of a pencil he happened to have about him, he
wrote this letter to me, describing the location
of the letters and how he had hidden them in a
bronze box wrapped in a burlap bag. He
urged me to go and get them at once, and then,
later, he could safely describe to his captors
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
where he had hidden them. Perhaps you wonder
how he expected to get this letter to me,
since he was so carefully guarded. He said
that he was on the third floor, front, of the
house, near a corner where he could see a post-box.
He happened to have a solitary stamp
in his pocket, which he put on the letter.
Then, at some hour when he thought his captors
were busy elsewhere, he expected to attract
the attention of some children playing
in the street and offer to throw them some
money if they would mail the letter in the
nearby box. As I received the letter, no doubt
his plan worked successfully. At any rate,
I got it a week ago and started on the trail immediately.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I landed out here one morning while it was
still dark, and dug all around the spot mentioned,
but couldn&#8217;t find a trace of the bag
or box.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I saw you that morning!&#8221; cried Leslie.
&#8220;But when you walked away you seemed to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
stoop and had a bad limp! I don&#8217;t understand!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you saw me,&#8221; he smiled, &#8220;or, at
least, that <i>some</i> one did, for as I happened to
glance back at this house, it was growing just
light enough for me to realize there was some
one watching at the window. So I adopted
that stoop and limp as I walked away, just so
you would not be likely to recognize me if
you saw me again. It is a ruse I&#8217;ve often
practised.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it didn&#8217;t work <i>that</i> time,&#8221; laughed Leslie,
&#8220;for I recognized you again this afternoon
by the way you dusted the sand off your hands
and threw away the stick!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you are certainly a more observing
person than most people!&#8221; he answered
gravely. &#8220;But to go on. Of course, I was
very much disappointed, but I remained here,
staying at the village hotel, and kept as close
a watch on the place as was possible, pretending
all the time that I was here on a fishing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
excursion. I tried very hard to keep out of
sight of these bungalows, in the daytime, anyway.
The day you all went off on the auto
ride the coast seemed clear, and I went through
the place. But I hadn&#8217;t been out of it long
and walked down to the beach, when I saw the
two men drive up in a car and enter the bungalow
also, and later come out to dig by that old
log. Of course, they didn&#8217;t see me about! I
took care of that. And I knew, beyond a
doubt, that they were Gaines&#8217;s Chinamen, come
to find the booty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course they didn&#8217;t find it, any more than
I had, and I felt sure they would go back and
make it hot for Gaines, and I judged that he
would probably try to gain time in some way.
I went back to my hotel that night to think it
all over and make further plans, and didn&#8217;t
visit the bungalow again till next evening,
when I found to my astonishment a queer note,
type-written, on the table there&mdash;a warning
that the article stolen from its hiding-place had
better be returned. And under it, a reply,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
printed in lead-pencil, saying it would be returned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t make head or tail of the business.
I judged the type-written part to have
been left by the Chinese. But who had scribbled
the other was a dark-brown mystery. At
any rate, I concluded that to-night would probably
be the crucial time, and determined to
get in ahead of every one else. The storm was
a piece of good fortune to me, as it concealed
things so well, and about nine o&#8217;clock I was
on the spot, proceeding to dig down by the old
log. Pretty soon I realized, though, that there
was some one else around. And just as I&#8217;d
unearthed the bag, which <i>had</i> been mysteriously
returned to its hiding-place, you appeared out
of somewhere, young man, fell on me like a
thousand of bricks, and we had a grand old
tussle. I&#8217;ll give you credit for being <i>some</i>
wrestler, but I was getting the best of it, when
along came you others with that terrible beast
and did the business for me!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I thought all along, though, that you, Mr.
Ted, were one of the Chinamen. But that
person must have been on the scene also, probably
lurking in the shelter of the bungalow and
watching the fracas. And when your electric
light blazed on the scene, Miss,&#8221; he turned to
Phyllis, &#8220;he no doubt saw the bag in my hand.
Then, when the light went out for a moment,
he rushed in and grabbed the prize and was
off while we two were so busy with one another!
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a losing game all around. While
I was in the village, I &#8217;phoned my department
in New York to meet his train when it got in
and arrest him, if they could find him, and
search him at once. But after I&#8217;d been to the
doctor&#8217;s (I had a long session there) I &#8217;phoned
them again and heard that the train had been
met, but no one answering such description as
I could give had got off. No doubt he was
canny enough to get off at some station short
of New York and so was lost to sight.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the prize is lost for this time, but
perhaps we can pick up the trail again. At
any rate, Gaines is probably free, for they
promised to release him as soon as the letters
were obtained.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When he had ceased speaking, Leslie got
up from her chair and disappeared into the
kitchen. When she returned, she laid a dark
bundle in the lap of Eileen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess the prize was found some time
ago!&#8221; she remarked quietly. &#8220;Suppose you
open that bag and see, Eileen!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And amid an astounded silence, Eileen&#8217;s
fingers managed to unloose the fastening of
the bag and insert themselves in its depths.
Then with a little cry of joy, she drew out and
held up, for all to view, the bronze box that
had caused all the disturbance&mdash;the Dragon&#8217;s
Secret!
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The complicated explanations were all over
at last, and the curious, fragmentary story was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
pieced together. Detective Barnes took up
the little bronze box and examined it carefully,
experimenting, as they all had done, to find a
way of opening it&mdash;and, of course, unsuccessfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing that puzzles me, though,&#8221;
remarked Ted, &#8220;about that queer type-written
note. How and why and by whom was it left
originally?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was written on thin, foreign-looking
paper,&#8221; replied the detective, &#8220;and I can only
guess that the foreigners left it there, though
probably not on their first trip that afternoon.
No doubt they either went to the village, or,
more likely, returned to the city to talk it
over, perhaps with Gaines. And he, supposing
I had long since captured the prize, and to
put them off the scent, suggested that some one
nearby may have been meddling with the matter
and that they leave a warning for them. I
feel rather certain he must have done this to
gain time, for he knew that if I had found
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
the thing, I would immediately set about having
him released, and he must have wondered
why I hadn&#8217;t done so. Perhaps he thought
I was having difficulty locating the house
where they had him hidden. But, Great
Scott!&mdash;that makes me think!&mdash;They must by
this time have discovered the trick you played,
Miss Phyllis, and be jumping mad over having
been so fooled. Perhaps they think
Gaines is responsible for it, and they&#8217;ll certainly
be making it hot for <i>him!</i> I must get
to the city immediately and get him out of
that hole. Oughtn&#8217;t to waste another minute.
If you can spare your car, Miss Eileen,
I&#8217;d like to run up to the city with it, as I
know there are no more trains to-night. I&#8217;ll
guarantee to fetch it and Gaines both back in
the morning!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly may have it,&#8221; replied Eileen,
&#8220;and you may take me with you and leave me
at the hospital, on the way. Grandfather
must know of this at once. I&#8217;m positive he&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
recover now, since the worry is all over. But
first, wouldn&#8217;t you all like to see something?
I happen to know the secret of opening this
box. Grandfather showed it to me when I
was a little girl, and he used to let me play with
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She took a pin from her dress, inserted it
into the carved eye of the dragon and pressed
it in a certain fashion&mdash;and the lid of the
bronze box flew up! They all pressed forward
eagerly and gazed in. There lay the packet of
foreign letters, safe and sound. Eileen lifted
them and looked curiously underneath. Nothing
else was in the box except some strange,
thin bits of yellow, foreign paper covered with
vague pictures and curious Chinese characters.
They seemed to be so thin and old as to be almost
falling to pieces.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what <i>these</i> things are,&#8221; she
remarked, &#8220;but they probably have nothing to
do with this affair, anyway. Grandfather
was always picking up queer old things
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
on his travels. But he must have thought them
interesting, or he never would have kept them
in here. But we must go now,&#8221; she ended,
closing the box. &#8220;And I&#8217;ll see you dear people
all to-morrow. This has surely been a
wonderful night!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But just as she was ready to go, she said:
&#8220;Do show me the dusty shelf where this was
hidden, please!&#8221; And then, as she stood gazing
up at it, she exclaimed, &#8220;To think that it
lay here behind those worn-out old kitchen
things all the time we were so madly hunting
for it! But perhaps it was the safest place,
after all!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two girls escorted Eileen and Mr.
Barnes to the door, Ted offering to see them
to the car. As they came out on the porch,
Leslie uttered a little cry of delight. The
storm, which all had momentarily forgotten in
the later excitement, was over. The ragged
clouds were driving by in a strong northwest
wind, and a few stars could be seen peeping
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
through the rifts, while, best of all, the water
had already retreated several feet, though the
crash of the breakers was still tremendous.
</p>
<p>As Leslie and Phyllis returned to the room,
they were startled to see Aunt Marcia, in a
dressing-gown, peering out of the door of her
room and blinking sleepily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth are you two girls doing up
at this unearthly hour?&#8221; she inquired. &#8220;I
woke and thought I heard voices and came out
to see!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ve been talking and watching the
storm!&#8221; laughed Leslie. &#8220;It&#8217;s all over now,
and the stars are shining. You&#8217;d better go
back to bed, Aunt Marcia. The fire&#8217;s out and
it&#8217;s very chilly!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And as the good lady turned back into her
room Leslie whispered to Phyllis, &#8220;And she
slept through all <i>that</i>&mdash;and never knew!
How can I be thankful enough!&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE BIGGEST SURPRISE OF ALL</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;PHYLLIS! I&#8217;ve got a nibble, Phyllis!
I believe I can land him, too. And it
will be the first I&#8217;ve really managed to catch!&#8221;
Leslie began to play her line, her hands fairly
trembling with excitement.
</p>
<p>The two girls and Ted stood at the ocean&#8217;s
edge, almost directly in front of the bungalows,
whiling away a glorious, crisp afternoon in
striving to induce the reluctant fish to bite.
For some reason or other, they seemed remarkably
shy that day. Leslie&#8217;s nibble had been
the first suggestion of possible luck. Just as
she was cautiously beginning to reel in her line
a pair of hands was clasped over her eyes, and
a gay voice laughed &#8220;Guess who!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eileen!&#8221; cried Leslie, joyfully, forgetting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
all about her nibble. &#8220;Oh, but it&#8217;s good to see
you! We&#8217;ve missed you so since you left.
Where <i>did</i> you come from?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandfather and I motored down to-day,&#8221;
replied Eileen, as they all crowded round her,
&#8220;to stay over night at Aunt Sally&#8217;s in the village.
He&#8217;s going to drive out here a little
later, with Geoffrey at the wheel, because he
wants to see you people. You know, we sail
for England on Saturday, and he says he
doesn&#8217;t intend to leave before he has a chance
to greet the friends who did so much for him!
You&#8217;ve no idea how much better he is! He
began to pick up the moment I told him the
news that night; and in the two weeks since,
he&#8217;s been like another person. But he hates
it in New York and it doesn&#8217;t agree with him,
and he just wanted to come down here once
more before we left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how did <i>you</i> get here, if he&#8217;s coming
later in the car?&#8221; demanded Phyllis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I <i>walked</i>, of course! It was a glorious
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
day for it. Aunt Sally wondered so, to see
me taking the air in anything but that car!
What a dear she is! And how scandalously
I had to treat her when I stayed there before.
But the dear lady never suspected that I was
in an agony of worry and suspense all the time,
and didn&#8217;t dare to be nice to her for fear I&#8217;d
just be tempted to give way and tell the whole
secret. I used to long to throw myself in
her lap and boo-hoo on her shoulder! I&#8217;ve
made it all up with her since, though! There&#8217;s
Grandfather now! Come up to the veranda,
all of you, because he&#8217;s not strong enough yet
to walk on the sand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They hurried up to the house and got there
in time for Eileen to make the introductions.
They were all deeply attracted to the tall,
stooping, gray-haired, pleasant-mannered gentleman
who greeted them so cordially&mdash;as if
they were old and valued friends instead of
such recent acquaintances.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to ask you to let me sit awhile
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
on your front veranda,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want to
get a last impression of this lovely spot to carry
away with me to England. Also, I would like
to have a chat with you young folks and tell
you how much I appreciate what you all did
for us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rather embarrassed by his suggestion that
there was anything to thank them for, Leslie
led him through the house to the veranda facing
the ocean. Here Aunt Marcia sat,
wrapped to the eyes, enjoying the late October
sunshine, the invigorating salt air, and the indescribable
beauty of the changeful ocean.
Leslie had long since, very cautiously and gradually,
revealed to her the story of their adventure
at Curlew&#8217;s Nest. So carefully had she
done so that any possible alarm Miss Marcia
might have experienced was swallowed up in
wonder at the marvelous way in which it had
all turned out.
</p>
<p>Leslie now introduced Mr. Ramsay, and
they all gathered around him as he settled himself
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
to enjoy the view. He chatted a while
with Miss Marcia, compared notes with her
on the effect of the climate on her health and
his own, then turned to the young folks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is quite useless for me,&#8221; he began, &#8220;to
try to express my appreciation of all you people
have done for Eileen and myself in the
little matter of the bronze box.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we must tell you,&#8221; interrupted Phyllis,
eagerly, &#8220;that we aren&#8217;t going to sail under
any false colors! We found that little box,&mdash;or
rather, Rags here found it&mdash;and we didn&#8217;t
have a notion, of course, to whom it could belong
and we were just wild to get it open and
see what was in it. When we couldn&#8217;t manage
that, we hid it away in the safest place we
could think of, to wait for what would happen.
I&#8217;m afraid we didn&#8217;t make any very desperate
hunt for the owner, and when we suspected that
Eileen might have something to do with it,
I&#8217;m ashamed to say that we wouldn&#8217;t give it
up to her&mdash;at first&mdash;because we were annoyed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
at the way she acted. We didn&#8217;t understand,
of course, but that doesn&#8217;t excuse it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All that you say may be true,&#8221; smiled Mr.
Ramsay, &#8220;but that does not alter the fact that
you delivered it up the moment you discovered
the rightful owner. And Miss Phyllis&#8217;s clever
little ruse of burying the false box probably
saved Geoffrey a bad time. For if those fellows
hadn&#8217;t found <i>something</i> there that night,
they would certainly have made it hot for him.
As it was, it gained us so much time that Detective
Barnes had a chance to get my man out
of their clutches before they had done him any
damage, though they were furious at being
duped. They&#8217;re all safely in jail now, and
there is nothing more to fear from them. Of
course, the principal who hired them is safe,
over in China, but he didn&#8217;t gain <i>his</i> point,&mdash;and
that&#8217;s the main thing! As for the letters,
I concluded that, after all, my ideas as to how
to keep them safely were out of date, and they
have long since been forwarded to Washington,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
in care of Barnes, and are now in the hands
of my country&#8217;s representative there. I shall
not concern myself any further about their
security.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He put his hands in his pocket and drew out
the little bronze casket. Then he went on,&mdash;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This little box has had some strange adventures
in its day, but nothing stranger than
the one it has just passed through. It has,
however, something else in it, that I thought
might be of interest to you, and so I have
brought it along and will explain about it.&#8221;
He opened the box in the same way as Eileen
had done and revealed to their curious gaze the
fragile old bits of paper they had seen on that
eventful night. He took them out, fingered
them thoughtfully, and handed one to each of
the four young folks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a strange little adventure connected
with these that perhaps you may be interested
to hear,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;It happened
when I was passing through the city of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
Peking, some years ago, during their revolution.
There was a good deal of lawlessness
rife at the time, and bands of natives were running
about, pillaging and looting anything they
thought it safe to tamper with. One day, in
one of the open places of the city, I happened
along just in time to see ten or a dozen lawless
natives pulling from its pedestal a great bronze
idol, hideous as they make &#8217;em, that had stood
there probably for uncounted centuries.
When they got it to the ground, they found it
to be hollow inside, as most of the really ancient
ones are, and filled with all manner of articles
representing the sacrifices that had been made
to it, through the ages, and placed inside it by
their priests. These articles included everything
from real jewels of undoubted value to
papier-mâché imitations of food&mdash;a device the
Chinese often use in sacrificing to the idols.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, the mob made an immediate
grab for the jewels, but it had begun to make
my blood boil to see them making off with so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
much unlawful booty. So, almost without
thinking, I snatched out my revolver, placed
myself in front of the pile, and shouted to
them that I would shoot the first one who laid
a finger on the stuff. And in the same breath
I sent Geoffrey hurrying to find some of the
city authorities to come and rescue what would
probably be some thousands of dollars&#8217; worth
of gems.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fortunately, I was armed with an effective
weapon and they were not. So I managed to
hold the fort till Geoffrey returned with the
authorities, and on seeing them, the mob
promptly melted away. The mandarin wanted
to present me with some of the jewels, in gratitude
for my services, but I had no wish for
them and only asked permission to take with
me a few of these little scraps of paper, which
had been among the medley of articles in the
idol&#8217;s interior. Of course they assented, deeming
me, no doubt, a very stupid &#8216;foreign devil&#8217;
to be so easily satisfied! I have carried
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
them about with me for several years, and now
I am going to give them to you young folks&mdash;one
to each of you, as a little token of my
gratitude for your invaluable help!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sat back in his chair, smiling benignly,
while he watched the bewilderment on all their
faces. Ted, Phyllis, and Leslie were striving
to hide this, under a polite assumption of intense
gratitude, though they were a bit puzzled
as to why he should choose <i>them</i>, of all
people, who had no very great interest in
such things, as recipients of this special gift.
But his own granddaughter was under less
compulsion to assume what she did not feel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is awfully good of you, Granddaddy!&#8221;
she cried, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t honestly see what the
big idea is! I think that story of yours was
ripping, but I don&#8217;t exactly know what to do
with this little bit of paper. It seems so old
and frail, too, that I&#8217;m almost afraid a breath
will blow it to pieces. I really think it will be
safer in your care.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>He was still smiling indulgently. &#8220;I suspected
that the outspoken Eileen would voice
the general opinion of this gift! I don&#8217;t mind
it in the least, and I don&#8217;t blame you a bit for
feeling a trifle bewildered about the matter.
But I haven&#8217;t told you the whole story yet.
To continue! As I said before, I carried these
bits of paper around with me for a number of
years, simply because they reminded me of my
little adventure. Then, one day early this past
summer, on the steamer coming across the Pacific,
I chanced to meet a man connected with
the British Museum whom I soon discovered
to be one of the principal experts on Chinese
antiquities. And it occurred to me to show
him these bits of paper and ask if he could
imagine what they were. He examined them
carefully and then came to me in great delight,
declaring that they certainly were, beyond a
shadow of doubt, the oldest existing specimens
of Chinese <i>paper money!</i>
</p>
<p>&#8220;And he added, moreover, that the British
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
Museum had no specimens in its possession as
old as these, and declared that he believed the
Museum would be delighted to buy them,
probably for three or four hundred pounds
apiece!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The listening four gasped and stared at him
incredulously, but he went on undisturbed.
&#8220;I said I would think the matter over and decide
when I reached England. But meantime,
for reasons which I have already enlarged
upon, I have decided instead to give them to
you, as a little testimonial of my deep gratitude.
If, by any chance, <i>you</i> should decide
that you would prefer to have the money, I
will attempt to negotiate the sale for you when
I reach London and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He got no further for, with a whoop of joy,
Ted sprang forward and laid his bit in Mr.
Ramsay&#8217;s lap and the others followed his example,
striving very inadequately to express
their wonder and delight.
</p>
<p>But he interrupted them, smilingly. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
should like to inquire, just as a matter of curiosity,
what form of investment each one of you
expects to make with the sum you receive?
Don&#8217;t think me too inquisitive please. It&#8217;s
just an old man&#8217;s curiosity!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve decided already!&#8221; cried Eileen.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to spend mine on another trip
over here in the spring to visit you girls, and
I&#8217;m going to bring mother with me. I
wouldn&#8217;t have got here this time if it hadn&#8217;t
been for Grandfather, for Daddy simply put
his foot down and said he couldn&#8217;t afford it.
And next year Grandfather may be in Timbuctoo
or somewhere like it, and I wouldn&#8217;t
have a chance. But I&#8217;ve just <i>got</i> to see you
all again soon, for you&#8217;re the best friends I
ever made.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m going to save mine for some extra
expensive courses in chemical engineering in
college that I never supposed I could afford
to take,&#8221; declared Ted. &#8220;I expected I&#8217;d
have to go into business after I graduated, for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
a year or two, till I scraped up enough, but
now I can go right on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I&#8217;ll get my music now,&#8221; cried
Phyllis, &#8220;and I&#8217;m the happiest girl alive!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s hardly necessary for me to say
that now little Ralph will have his chance to
be strong and well, like other boys,&#8221; murmured
Leslie, tears of joy standing in her
eyes.
</p>
<p>Then, to ease the tension of the almost too
happy strain, Mr. Ramsay continued:
</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is another member of this party
that it would not do to forget!&#8221; He drew
from his pocket a handsome leather and silver
dog-collar, called Rags over to him, and, as
the dog ambled up, gravely addressed him:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kindly accept this token of my immense
gratitude and allow me to clasp it about your
neck!&#8221; Rags submitted gravely while his old
collar was removed and the new one put in
place, and immediately after began to make
frantic efforts to get it off over his head! But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
Mr. Ramsay only laughed and held up a five
dollar bill, adding:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I realize that you do not entirely appreciate
this gift at present. In fact, I sympathize
with you in thinking it a decided nuisance!
But here is something else that may
soothe your sorrow&mdash;a five-dollar bill, to be devoted
exclusively to the purchase of luscious
steaks, tender chops, and juicy bones&mdash;for
your solitary delectation!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Amid the general laughter that followed, he
added: &#8220;And now, may I ask that you escort
me over to the veranda of Curlew&#8217;s Nest? I
have a great desire to walk up and down on
that porch for a few moments and think of all
the strange adventures of which that delightful
little bungalow has been the scene!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And accompanied by Rags, still striving
madly to scrape off his new collar by rubbing
it in the sand, they escorted their guest to Curlew&#8217;s
Nest!
